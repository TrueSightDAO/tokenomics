[3/27/23, 2:20:24 PM] Gary Teh: As mentioned earlier, the governors will be scheduling a meeting for next week, where governors will be discussing how we will go about rolling out the new governance model that @381644913030 has very kindly drafted up 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUBd6E2cFwFMBDLURS-SxCY75AlJ7sPtUklXi0N8hR4/edit?usp=sharing

Non-governors will be welcomed to sit in during that session as an observer 

In-line with the new governance model, EcoVerse21 will be having a meeting where active members discuss and define the tokenizable actions within the scope of that project 

EcoVerse21 will submit for approval to our main DAO governance tokens allocation to facilitate out the next phase of its planned roadmap

In hindsight splitting our main channel into the Beer Hall and the Town Hall with separate but very well defined context make absolute sense

My stance, being very rule based profile, I follow the 3/7 principle

If 3 members independently complain about a phenomena, it falls under the might need to address category of problems

If 7 members independently complain about a phenomena, it falls under the must be addressed ASAP category of problems 

I remember Reid mentioning his strategy of triaging when they were rapidly scaling LinkedIn in the early days. 

Something was always going wrong all the time. And it is impossible to fix everything during blitz scaling mode. 

The most important task is to figure out which are the subset of most critical problems that must be addressed and the rest can continue burning while the team heads back home to sleep

[4/3/23, 3:22:03 AM] Gary Teh: The irony of things, I remember when I was in the Mojave desert back in early 2021 during winter and was coming to a conclusion to myself it was probably not a good idea to have built an entire webscraping infrastructure tuned specifically for AI model training needs. This conclusion was due to the total lack of companies operating in the space 

Fast forward two years later, we are suddenly seeing an explosion in the population size of companies operating in the AI space. 

I am right now in my head toying with how to extend our  DAO’s tokenomics to include GetData.IO as part the ecosystem and if that works out, start channeling part of its monthly subscription revenue proceeds to our DAO’s vault as defined in the governance framework defined by @381644913030 in exchange for DAO support

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUBd6E2cFwFMBDLURS-SxCY75AlJ7sPtUklXi0N8hR4/edit?usp=sharing

Two areas where GetData.IO could potentially benefit regarding assistance from the DAO would be data set discovery/creation and marketing of these datasets to Ai companies that need these data sets 

One area where GetData.IO could extend the utility of our governance tokens is to start accepting it in exchange for data downloads

Open to any thoughts you might have. Let’s discuss 🙂👍

[4/4/23, 6:28:28 PM] Gary Teh: Been chatting with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 for the past two hours. 

Seems we gotten down to first principles during our discussions which tied somehow to the key principles of Buddhism

3 nature of reality
- impermanent 
- unsatisfactory 
- no-self

Anytime any of this three is transgressed, craving and aversion naturally arises 

Any individual who can’t self regulate away this craving and aversion will end up paying to have it go away

Any Business model needs to fundamentally address a key craving or aversion that a large enough group of people have, other it serves no purpose 

I believe that should be the core component in each of our projects 

That said, @5491125130580  has proposed a technical solution that could be implemented for Cypher defense. We will test the value proposition against 10 subjects in our defined target market tomorrow when we visit the local tech hub to verify their willingness to pay USD10 for the pain to go away 

If they do, then we would have very cheaply validated a monthly subscription business model for cypher defense
[8/16/23, 8:02:59 PM] Gary Teh: What becomes really interesting would be to map out the turn by turn behavior of people who successfully adopted adopted cacao nibs for their daily diet. Figure out what the generalized patterns are

Then figure out how to help other people following keto diet quickly onboard on to the same set of behavioral patterns

[4/5/23, 5:57:15 PM] Gary Teh: I think it became really obvious after today’s 8 hours long discussion with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 that what initially catalyzed TrueSight DAO coming into being was figuring out a complex solution in a decentralized manner to tackle the complex multi faceted problem of fake news.

However when our DAO started experimenting with forking the original prediction market project last august and opening up our ecosystem to support new projects that are aligned with our core values of Autonomy, Integrity and Diveristy, it catalyzed a shift in our collective narration

Fast forward 8 months into this collective inductive process, seems our mission has fully shifted away from tackling fake news 

Right now, taking a step back and looking at our DAO as a external observer, what is obvious is our DAO is really attempting to find an answer to this three questions 


1) Autonomy to be - Discovering what the future form of organization is. One that is rule based and without a central authority. One where individuals have the freedom to grow in any direction their professional aspiration takes them. 

2) Integrity to self - Discovering how communities of people could collaborate and work together in an asynchronous and distributed fashion that allows them to live with integrity that is aligned with their high order purpose. The second order effect of this is that we should see less people experiencing anxiety and depression

3) Preserving our diversed natural ecosystems - Discovering and implementing business models that are not just aligned with profits but also aligned with nature.

[4/5/23, 6:29:45 PM] Gary Teh: In essence all the spaces within our DAO are endeavors by our community to bring our core values to different domains of concern. I usually refer to the game Unchartered Waters as well as the activities of the British East India company when describing the domains of concern.

These are namely Exploration, Commerce and Military.


SunMint ( our DAO's physical territories )
    - in the near term. Preserving the autonomy of our DAO so as to negate the need for external financing by directly converting solar energy into BitCoins which we can then use to finance other projects within our ecosystem. 
    - In the long term, establishing an off the grid data center network which we will run Edgar from.
    - In the long term, a worldwide network of facilities that DAO members can stay when move from one geographical territory to another


Edgar (Exploration - insight generation)
    - right now: providing the much needed integrity for financial news to help community make financial decisions so that they can retain autonomy on how they live their lives. 
    - future vision: the bot that will answer any questions new members might have about our history and how they can onboard
    

Beer Hall (Exploration - insight generation)
   - providing multifaceted interpretation of current occurrences within the realms of geopolitics


Ecoverse21 (Commerce)
    - Building a trading network that fosters adoption of sustainable farming practices worldwide, with its integrity secured by the use of blockchain. 
    - Firstly, this preserves the autonomy of small scale farmers. 
    - Secondly, preserves diversity within our natural ecosystem by fighting against large scale mono-culture farming practices which are not sustainable


Cypher Defense (Military)
    - Providing the integrity layer that protects members against phishing scams which attempt to compromise the autonomy of web3 actors through disinformation practices.

[4/5/23, 11:23:28 PM] Anupa/diya: The approach and the data collected from the various people contributing for the past months will be feeding back into the website .Aleksa has proposed the governance mechanism .

The website will be what Gary has already created in terms of the management of the token and etc along with the newer additions

There is a need to put all this information to make it more manageable from for existing members to know the processes and opportunities that are available to further develop so they can make better informed decisions moving forward 

 and for newer members to know which route they can adopt

The main outcome is that as a DAO we become more proactive not only in conversation but in other aspects. To acknowledge where do I stand and what we would like to do. 

We are also currently defining the roles people are adopting on the DAO and also what the other roles required for the DAO and independent projects 

I would urge everyone to join this conversation via the figma or independently so we have a collective and comprehensive vision as a community
[8/18/23, 5:22:31 PM] Gary Teh: Then and only then broken into nibs

[4/8/23, 5:20:34 AM] Gary Teh: Hi folks, @918017107841 has very kindly assembled a list of grants that we could start applying to to fill up our DAO’s treasury.

The reason why we want to fill up our treasury is to enable us to pursue some of our project goals which will require some amount of fiat. 

The list can be found here 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UXh0HmeRbZTS705XIli-UEiSJioMg4zArd7BTeoi5o/edit

Before we go about the phase of applying to these grants, I would like to propose that we add more sources that we might be aware of to the list 

This activity is a tokenizable one. Each new line entry will yield you 25TDG 

In the next phase, we will go through and apply for liquidity from the listed grants. 

Each application attempt will yield you 100TDG  

Each successful application will yield you 10% of the grant amount received 

This means if you successfully helped our DAO bring in USD10,000 worth of grants, you will be awarded 1000TDG. 🙂👍
[8/18/23, 5:39:44 PM] Tess walkowski: It looks worn or aged.
[4/8/23, 5:23:59 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s aim to compile what we can by the end of this month 🙂👍

We will start raising funds for our treasury beginning of next month. 

I will do an official kick off of our fundraising phase during the key note I will be giving in front of the German government delegates and the crypto whales present during the crypto rockstar star conference in Cologne, Germany

[8/18/23, 5:40:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is why asked if it was raw
[4/8/23, 8:31:57 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through our DAO’s operating process just now, it occurred to me there might end up being potential conflict of interest between contributors within the scope of projects 

This scenario arises when project members collaboratively do RnD within the scope of a project and a member chooses to take the collective work done and spin up a separate project on the side to privately capture the value of the efforts for himself/herself

Let’s do a poll to get a sense of our stance on this matter 🙂
[8/18/23, 5:40:35 PM] Tess walkowski: I thought maybe roasting would sweeten
[4/8/23, 8:34:12 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
members should be allowed to take RnD materials surfaced within the project chatrooms and privately use these for their personal gains

[8/18/23, 5:41:03 PM] Tess walkowski: There is something on the nose and less in the taste and I don't smell it on my criolla
[4/8/23, 9:47:03 AM] Alessandro Mele: Good point @14153000019 ! I think we should have another option, which I would vote for. Which is to allow members to monetise outside of the DAO the RnD developed as long as such member notifies the DAO of such intentions, invites other members who had contributed to such RnD to the spin off and a commercial agreement is reached for the commercial exploitation of such RnD. If no agreement is reached I would agree with point 1 as unilaterally exploring RnD developed with the contribution of others would be unethical.

Definitely there seems to be a need to figure such a framework that allows DAO members to commercialize the RnD efforts of the DAO and then channel part of the proceeds of the commercialization to re-energize the DAO. 

In essence allow the natural formation of a symbiotic relationship 🙂🙏
[8/18/23, 6:02:10 PM] Tess walkowski: I wanna grind it and try it sweetened
[4/8/23, 4:08:28 PM] Gary Teh: In fact from my perspective, such a legal framework would be useful for other DAOs in the future as well. 

It would be useful to hear the thoughts of legal practitioners here in our community 

@41799155602 @381644913030 @41791555798 🙂👍
[8/18/23, 6:02:23 PM] Tess walkowski: And I can experiment on body cream.
[4/8/23, 10:19:35 PM] Gary Teh: I posed this question to ChatGpt 

What is a good legal framework that we can use to ensure members do not utilize RnD materials contributed by other members in the DAO in an unauthorized manner that does not benefit the DAO?
[8/18/23, 6:02:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll retest tomorrow
[4/8/23, 10:20:00 PM] Gary Teh: When it comes to ensuring that members do not utilize RnD materials contributed by other members in the DAO in an unauthorized manner that does not benefit the DAO, a good legal framework to consider is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

An NDA is a legal document that protects sensitive or confidential information that is shared between two or more parties. It can be used to protect intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and other confidential information. An NDA ensures that members are prohibited from disclosing any confidential information to unauthorized individuals, using it for their advantage outside of the DAO, or utilizing certain intellectual property rights in a way that is detrimental to the DAO.

The following are the key elements of a basic NDA framework that can be adapted to fit the requirements of your DAO:

1. Definition of Confidential Information: The NDA should define the types of information that are considered confidential and should not be disclosed outside the DAO without prior written authorization.

2. Scope of Confidentiality: The NDA should specify the scope of confidentiality, including the duration of the non-disclosure obligation and the purpose for which the confidential information is being shared.

3. Obligations of the Recipient: The NDA should specify the obligations and responsibilities of the recipient towards the confidential information, including how the recipient can use the confidential information and who can access it.

4. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights: The NDA should describe how any intellectual property rights associated with the confidential information will be protected.

5. Remedies and Enforcement: The NDA should include provisions for breach of the agreement, which should clarify the remedies available to the disclosing party, including legal actions and damages.

It is important to consider the possible legal consequences of a breach of an NDA and to seek legal advice to ensure that the legal framework is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. The NDA will establish a legal framework that protects your DAO's intellectual property rights, ensures trust between members and promotes the development of RnD materials among the participants.
[8/18/23, 6:02:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Honestly, concerned something is maybe off, but I haven't had all nibs
[4/8/23, 10:25:39 PM] Gary Teh: I posed the question to ChatGpt to come up with a legal framework to do so with this question 

Create a legal framework that allows member to utilize RnD materials contributed by other DAO members which allows them to commercialize these RnD efforts while allowing for a symbiotic relationship between the newly registered entities commercializing the RnD and the DAO which seeded the RnD efforts
‎[8/18/23, 6:03:11 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎image omitted
[4/8/23, 10:25:52 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Sure, below is a legal framework that a DAO can use to allow members to utilize RnD materials contributed by other members, leading to the commercialization of these RnD efforts, while developing a symbiotic relationship between the newly registered entities and the DAO which seeded the RnD efforts:

1. Licensing Agreement: The DAO will enter into a licensing agreement with the newly registered entities that will allow them to utilize the RnD materials contributed by other DAO members under specific terms and conditions. This licensing agreement will outline the scope of fees for utilization, the manner in which these fees will be apportioned, the restrictions and obligations, and the expected period of commercialization.

2. Intellectual Property Ownership: Each contributing member of the RnD effort should retain the right to own their respective IP, and such ownership rights will be outlined in the licensing agreement.

3. Revenue Sharing and Royalties: The licensing agreement will contain terms and conditions for revenue sharing and royalties, where the DAO will receive a share of the revenue generated from the commercialization of RnD efforts. The terms of revenue sharing will be proportional to the amount of RnD financing contributed by the DAO, stakeholders, or contributors.

4. Compliance: The entities that commercialize the RnD will be required to comply with all legal, regulatory, and governance requirements, standards, and guidelines, specifically those that are relevant to the product, service, or technology that the RnD efforts focused on.

5. Termination Clause: The licensing agreement will contain a termination clause, specifying how the agreement may be terminated in the event of a material breach or expiration of the term.

6. Liability and Indemnity: The licensing agreement will allocate risks between the DAO and the newly registered companies, outlining their respective rights in case of liability incidents that may arise as a result of the agreement.

7. Dispute Resolution: The licensing agreement should contain a dispute resolution clause that outlines the procedures for resolving disputes between each of the parties.

In conclusion, this framework should align the interests of both parties. It is important to caution that a proper assessment of regulatory compliance requirements and applicable jurisdictional laws should be reviewed with legal assistance during the drafting of the agreement. Additionally, it is necessary to provide updated use-case data and the establishment of methods to monitor the process regularly to ensure that the commercialization process is working and that fair compensation to all parties involved is taking place.
[8/18/23, 6:03:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Inhales nibs to try to explain.
[4/9/23, 7:37:58 AM] Gary Teh: I posed this question 

What is the best way to generate revenue for a DAO with a purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth and the core values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity?
[8/18/23, 6:03:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I ate a few
[4/9/23, 7:38:09 AM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Generating revenue for a DAO focused on building a better world based on verifiable truth and core values of autonomy, integrity, and diversity should align with the organization's mission and ethos. Here are some potential strategies for generating revenue:

1. Non-Profit Initiatives: Partnering with non-profit organizations focused on similar goals as the DAO could help generate revenue, through fundraising or grant applications. Revenue can also be generated through a focus on charitable goals or via donations. 

2. Digital Applications and Tools: Developing or funding applications and tools that enable the spread of truth, transparency, and equity can generate revenue for the DAO. A few examples could be building a decentralized verification platform or a truth-tracking application or a fact-checking tool.

3. Membership and Platform Fees: Offering premium access plans, subscriptions or partnerships with the DAO, or charging fees for using the platform could generate revenue for the DAO.

4. Invest in Impactful Businesses: Investing in impactful businesses and start-ups that share a common goal of spreading truth, integrity, and diversity can be a revenue-generating opportunity. By utilizing the wealth of knowledge and resources within the DAO, successful business ventures can translate into returns on investment for the DAO.

5. Sustainable and Ecological Projects: Funding eco-friendly ventures aimed at building a healthy and sustainable community aligns with the DAO's mission, and there's a potential to create revenue streams from ventures that align with these values to the benefit of the DAO.

6. Crowdfunding: Approach investors who share the DAO's goals and help support DAO growth through channels like crowdfunding platforms.

In Summary, generating revenue for a DAO focused on spreading truth, integrity and diversity may require exploratory and novel approaches. It is essential to take advantage of the DAO's community and strengths to create value and require a maintained sense of integrity and transparency in all business endeavours. With proper planning and execution, these revenue-generating strategies have the potential to ensure sustainable growth while continuing to uphold the DAO's core values.

[4/10/23, 1:50:12 PM] Gary Teh: The response 

A project leader can benefit from joining a DAO by accessing community resources, crowdfunding opportunities, decentralized governance, reduced operational costs, access to talent, community support and increased transparency.
[8/18/23, 6:39:10 PM] Gary Teh: Or even the fermentation process

[8/18/23, 7:10:07 PM] Tess walkowski: That's like apples to oranges 😀
[4/10/23, 6:17:09 PM] Gary Teh: Posed this same question to ChatGpt 

Our DAO has the purpose of building a better world based on fundamental truth with the core values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good scalable process we could use to process all incoming requests by DAO member seeking funding support from other DAO members?
[8/18/23, 7:10:45 PM] Tess walkowski: When we press it it comes out a paste..... I sent you a video long ago showing that
[4/10/23, 6:17:21 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

To process incoming funding requests from DAO members seeking support from other members, a good scalable process could include the following steps:

1. Set up Clear Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for members whose projects are seeking funding support, including eligibility criteria, funding limits, expected outcomes, and community involvement.

2. Verification and Validation: Verify that the proposed project aligns with the DAO's mission, vision, and values and meets the criteria set in the funding guidelines.

3. Proposal Submission: Allow members to submit their proposals and all necessary documentation online.

4. Review and Evaluation: Assign a group of expert reviewers to evaluate proposals based on specific criteria, rating them and providing feedback.

5. Presentation and Q&A: Allow project leaders to present their proposals and answer questions from the review team and the wider community.

6. Community Discussion and Feedback: Create a forum or chatroom for community members to discuss and provide feedback about the proposed projects.

7. Vote: Allow DAO community members to vote based on the proposal's details and how it aligns with the DAO's mission, vision, and values.

8. Disbursement: Disburse funding to successful projects based on the DAO's governance model and the voting outcomes.

By implementing these scalable processes, the DAO can review and finance projects that align with its core values while avoiding funding ineffective or incompatible projects. This process ensures that the DAO maintains its integrity, autonomy and inclusivity, and enables community collaboration towards realizing the DAO's vision of building a better world based on fundamental truth.
[8/18/23, 7:11:36 PM] Tess walkowski: They ferment them in trays
[4/10/23, 6:18:41 PM] Gary Teh: Feels like if we did a deep dive into each of the 8 points surfaced by ChatGpt and collated them onto a document we would have a complete well defined process for handling all incoming funding request by DAO members
[8/18/23, 7:11:59 PM] Tess walkowski: And roast them in cast iron pots on an open fire....lightly
[4/10/23, 8:39:01 PM] Anupa/diya: There are a handful group building the project now we need an active a community. If would be great of people to voice what they are thinking in terms of moving forward or changing direction
[8/18/23, 7:16:34 PM] Tess walkowski: And then we put them in a meat grinder
[4/10/23, 8:43:03 PM] Anupa/diya: Great ideas/ Great network of people in Tru sight 


 Cypher defense will some push can be actualized. It's ready for funding and a roll out plan.

Ecoverse . Is ready for research 

Sun mint is ready to roll 

Or do make trusight a place where newer communities create their pitch decks via tru sight Dao process,  uploads it to the community, and communities votes for it to go to the "stage" for investors to take a call.

We just built this community so they can network and build their connections.  Foster connections 

Do we have scrap this and concentrate on sun mint and building sustainability for community where sun mint will be built

Propose us a set of bylaws we could use for our incorporation as a cooperative in Switzerland
[8/19/23, 3:16:02 PM] [ops] The Town Hall: ‎You changed the group description
[4/13/23, 11:19:33 AM] Gary Teh: This was its response 

Sure, I can propose a set of bylaws for TrueSight DAO's incorporation as a cooperative in Switzerland, based on your stated purpose and core values. Please note that this is just an example and should be reviewed and adapted by a qualified legal professional:

ARTICLE 1 – NAME, SEAT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Name: The name of the cooperative shall be TrueSight DAO.

1.2 Seat: The seat of the cooperative shall be established in Switzerland, at a place to be determined by the board of directors.

1.3 Purpose: The purpose of the cooperative is to build a better world based on verifiable truth, powered by decentralized technologies. To this end, the cooperative seeks to promote the development, adoption and use of blockchain, smart contract, and other decentralized technologies to advance the principles of Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity.

ARTICLE 2 – MEMBERSHIP

2.1 Eligibility: Any individual or legal entity that shares the purpose and values of the cooperative may become a member by submitting a membership application and paying any required membership fees.

2.4 Cost of Membership: The board of directors shall determine the amount of the membership fees, as well as any other fees, contributions or investments required from the members.

ARTICLE 3 – ORGANIZATION

3.1 Organs: The cooperative shall be composed of the following organs: the general assembly, the board of directors, and the auditors.

3.2 General Assembly: The general assembly shall be the highest decision-making body of the cooperative and shall meet at least once per year. It shall be composed of all members of the cooperative and shall have the power to elect and remove the members of the board of directors and the auditors, approve the bylaws and the annual report, and decide on any other matters requiring a vote by the members.

3.3 Board of Directors: The board of directors shall be composed of at least three members, elected by the general assembly for a term of three years. The board shall be responsible for the overall management and direction of the cooperative, as well as for implementing the decisions of the general assembly.

3.4 Auditors: The auditors shall be responsible for verifying the cooperative's accounts and financial statements, as well as for reporting to the general assembly on their findings.

ARTICLE 4 – DISSOLUTION

4.1 Dissolution: The cooperative may be dissolved by a decision of the general assembly, taken by a two-thirds majority of the members present. In case of dissolution, the assets of the cooperative shall be distributed to one or several non-profit organizations with similar purposes, as determined by the general assembly.

[4/14/23, 12:00:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: The problem with ChatGPT is that it is generic while we are in a more or less uncharted and highly international area where the law gets very fuzzy. When I read something like point 4. Compliance .. I wonder if anyone knows what to do then? The solution is: tailor made proper contractual arrangements, selecting carefully your partners and some tech to help with the evidence if it gets ugly. 
People take ideas if they are not protected or the law enforcement is too complicated, expensive or simply impossible. 
We would need 1. a consent in the group eg as Alessandro suggested and 2. identification of the members and 3. traceability. Still then … it can happen.
[8/19/23, 3:36:11 PM] Gary Teh: Updated thinking the purpose on our three major channels

*beer hall*: all business development matters

*town hall*: all daily operational matters

*do nothing society*: where we explore how we can apply the principle of Wu-Wei (无为) effortless action from the book of TAO (道德经) to shape our DAO’s culture
[4/14/23, 12:22:57 AM] Anupa/diya: What I can suggest is that all the relevant information that is being put in a chat. Let's add to it to a document which that then be edited
[8/20/23, 6:31:53 PM] Gary Teh: Me and @16468233438 have consolidated the notes from our focus group

We are planning to have a debrief session tomorrow. This session will impact three things 


    - filter for sourcing
    - choice of packaging
    - supply chain configuration
[4/14/23, 12:23:06 AM] Anupa/diya: As a the final source
[8/20/23, 6:41:05 PM] Anupa/diya: This is great. Did you guys manage to document with photos
[4/14/23, 12:24:47 AM] Anupa/diya: It can be done for all the active groups as eventually we can have to start accumulating the information constructively
[8/20/23, 7:44:43 PM] Gary Teh: Not much. 

Here are the notes

[4/14/23, 4:33:35 AM] Gary Teh: There is this function. We could potentially feed it to with ChatGpt to get a summary of our weekly discussions. 

Or at a much later stage, extend Edgar to support large language AI model function and then feed Edgar with it to get our daily summary 

From my perspective feeding Edgar with it will be helpful not just for getting summaries. Since Edgar will primarily be feed only with data we trained it, it will become our dedicated Oracle  to answer members (new, old and prospective) any questions pertaining to our DAO

They were really really impressed by the premium packaging but preferred the brown paper looking Kraft pouch packaging as it felt earthier and made they feel more connected to the farmers which was more aligned with our brand story

[4/14/23, 4:59:26 AM] Anupa/diya: The thing is that once you export the data. It normally exports who is saying what. That data ie names has to be extracted before it is feed to chatgtp. Chatgtp also says do not feed it with names and emails.

Is there any other way that we are not so dependent on chatgtp. Maybe some sort of function on the website ?
‎[8/21/23, 10:03:47 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/14/23, 5:43:08 AM] Gary Teh: That is why I mentioned in the future we could extend Edgar with a large language model function (essentially what ChatGpt is)

Right now no other cheap and affordable way to go about it 

Unless having these summarizes is super urgent and too priority , I would suggest we hold off on it for now

The reason is because setting up such a facility…  


Option A - do our own on AWS 
1) takes up a lot of engineering effort

2) costly to maintain if using AWS infrastructure 


Option B - do on ChatGpt
1) Leads to privacy concerns


Maintaining our own infrastructure once the Sunmit off grid data center facility (initially used for mining Bitcoin) becomes viable since the infrastructure cost is just the initial sunk cost used to setup the facility

[4/14/23, 7:08:13 AM] Dr. Denis: Karin used to work for MME - the leading Swiss legal firm focused on crypto and then established her own legal practice. So, her services should be more affordable compared to traditional legal firms. Fabio (founder of AMX) is the legal advisor of my own crypto project. We’ve already done some work together and the service was good & readonably priced. In any case you have to talk to those lawyers in order to get a quotation for your specific case

*Verdict*
    - we will import the 100KG raw from Brazil, rent a certified kitchen here in Bay Area and package the initial 100KG
    - @16468233438 will continue to run focus groups using the 6 samples even after I leave for Brazil to collect enough data on which taste to lock in on
    - I will passing the winning sample over to the President of the Brazilian Cooperative to lock down the taste to be delivered

    - Conducted an outdoor photo shoot of our product by the beach
    - Updated the official agroverse.shop to attempt at incorporating some of the elements that @918017107841 has created
    - Locked down the supply chain configuration we will be utilizing for this initial 100KG (Shipped from Brazil. Packaged in USA)

This upcoming exercise reminds me of this casual conversation I had with a senior engineer back in Edmodo one day (he helped built a huge section of the Unix kernel). 

I asked him what was his Ikigai. What drives him to wake up everyday and still come to the work. His response “pay bills…”

“That’s it!?!” I replied incredulously surprised by his total honesty and thorough lack of thought on how he uses his life 😱

Well… he quit and left the company two weeks. I guess that conversation was a wake up call for him 🤣

2. members who need advisory inputs to further their personal projects will also need to start paying in DAO tokens 

3. Members who want to advertise their personal projects in any of our channels will first need to pay DAo tokens otherwise all advertisements will be automatically removed by administrators 

Properly these values  have been freely made available to members. However to ensure the continued health of our network, there will be no more free passes in our network 🙂👍

Response 
———
Sure. 

From my perspective it is less about revenue (since no fiat changes hand during the entire process) and more about conserving precious time, attention and resource of network members.These are the property of the commons for this community. 

Everyone loves a space where they can gain access to “free” expert advisory, “free” introductions as well as a “free” channel to advertise their projects. 

The flip side is this value does not come “free” though and maybe subjected to the abuse by less mindful members in the network. 

When that occurs everyone on the receiving side end up spending their time and energy on contents/requests that are not truly aligned to their own purpose. 

This is especially true after receiving lot of feedback from members who have disengaged due to there being too much messages in the chatrooms and too much inbound requests. 

Having such policies in place will ensure some form of merit based filter on the requests passing through the network. And if it does pass through the network, recipients can be confident the requester has accumulated enough merit/good kharma in the network. 

Plus after close observation spanning close to two years, it seems less mindful members with abusive inclinations will naturally choose to leave the network after achieving their personal goals anyways. 

Having this set of policy only serves to hasten the process while minimizing the impact of their behavior on other members.

overall it is also positive to provide governors with a coherent policy to follow regarding requests that are passing through the network. 

And all these we can bake into the smart contracts on the blockchain later on and manage via UI/UX of our supporting community website. 

As suggested by @5491125130580, @918017107841 and @5511982667030, we now prepare our grounds to plant the seeds for the virtuous cycle to truly start flourishing within our community 



PS: I Will be busy preparing for the keynote I will be giving in Germany at the conference that @491736386942 has kindly organized, over the next few days. There I will be presenting the learnings of our DAO’s meta-game social experiments (basically what we are collectively engaged in right now)

Open to having a zoom call after that. 

Will send a lettuce meet link once I arrive in bogota 🙂👍

Just to clarify pertaining to a question asked earlier by @41765737357 which might be your minds as well 

No, The second option doesn’t mean you will be forced to leave the network. It is just a statement of how strongly you feel against the introduction of the proposed policies to protect member privacy, to such an extend you will exercise your right to Rage Quit. 

Rage Quitting is a common phenomena. As members of TrueSight DAO you have every right to exercise this option if you feel the direction the DAO is headed is not in alignment with your core purpose and runs contrary to your core values 🙂👍

[4/26/23, 10:11:30 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the issues raised by @5491125130580 and @918017107841 

It makes sense from a productivity perspective to have the types of required roles defined upfront for each project and when members in our DAO request to join those project groups they will undergo a separate onboarding process for each of these projects 

During the onboarding process it will become apparent whether they will be a good fit for the project’s needs and when they do finally get into those channels, it will be crystal clear how they will be expected to contribute 

There will exist this scenario where a DAO member desiring to join a project might not be admitted to it due to a lack of fit. 

Based on my observations over the past year, allowing free for all entry into project groups without proper onboarding process is a generally confusing experience for bulk of folks who have undergone the experience 

Taking a step back, I noticed even in prior organizations I am part there exist only around 2.5% to 5% of the population are comfortable navigating unstructured and uncertain environments. The rest of the 95% just curl up in confusion feeling totally lost. These latter folks will need some form of structure in place before they can be let in.

[4/26/23, 5:59:09 PM] Gary Teh: The business analyst is more an inner facing role, managing and directing the efforts of all the internal folks operating within the scope of the project.

The facilitator is more an external facing role. Helping recruit for roles into these projects when the open up. Also the facilitator will have the task of facilitate the transition of project members out of the scope once the project has grown beyond the phase where the skill set is of direct relevance 

The business analyst will work with the facilitator to define the newly required roles as and when needed

[4/26/23, 6:09:28 PM] Gary Teh: I noticed while overseeing various projects over the past year that members will try to surface business ideas within the scopes, however when requested to practice the full discipline of filling out the business model canvas, it came to my attention bulk of them do not have the necessary business background training to even think in terms of profit and losses statements much less fill up a full business model canvas which assumes an underlying profit and loss statement. The ideas they surface when examined critically are generally piecemeal and not useful. 

After collecting a year’s worth of data, my conclusion is the right profile to drive a project forward should at least be someone who has had some training in business, financial accounting or had built and ran a revenue generating startup. 

As for the other folks, their skill set lies elsewhere, some in graphics, others in engineering, others in gaining followers and driving eyeballs, others in writing compelling articles, others in simply just being likable thus having relationships with a lot of people in influential positions. Others in building rock solid software systems

rather than set them up for failure by forcing them to operate in areas they are weak at, we should tap into their strengths by correctly profiling them and only introducing them into the projects when these projects reach the stage where their skill sets become directly applicable. Meanwhile the facilitator should keep everybody posted on the progress of various projects

So we have tested a full decentralized approach the whole of last year.

Now let’s scale it back and attempt a semi-centralized structure within the scope of projects

[4/27/23, 8:38:33 AM] Gary Teh: Seems our collective stance has became unanimously apparent. While we wait for it to close out, I see two approaches in determining the amount of DAO tokens to be charged for scenarios 1 (request for introduction) and 2 (expert advisory). 

Approach 1: Charges will be calculated based on total token holdings of DAO member who has been approached to make introduction or provide expert advisory.

The formula will be [Total Member Token Holdings] X 10% / 80%

If requesting for expert advisory or introduction from a member who has 30K tokens the total amount of tokens the requester will need to pay is 3750 tokens

The member providing the advisory or introduction will receive 3000 tokens while 750 tokens will be returned to our DAO's vault thereby removed from circulation.

The advantage of this approach is that members seeking to access this utility will be mindful on whom they approach for their request especially members with a high standing in our community and only quality request pass through the network. 

Approach 2: Charges will be calculated based on corresponding amount in our rubric / 80%

If requesting for an introduction in an investor from a member our rubric indicates this action is worth 50 tokens. So the total amount of tokens to be charged to the requestor will be 62.5 tokens. 

The member making the introduction will receive 50 tokens, while 12.5 tokens is returned to our vault and removed from circulation. 

The advantage of this approach is that the utility is more accessible to members who need introductions. The drawback is our network might get flooded with a lot of requests and members will start experiencing request fatigue again. 

Let's get a quick sense of which direction our community is inclined towards

[5/2/23, 7:55:07 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the decision on our guild onboarding policy is now apparent 

We have revised the white papers for both EcoVerse21 and Sunmint guilds

The financing structure and the operating roles are defined therein 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper

https://truesight.me/dao/sunmint/whitepaper

The raising of fiat financing will be done via NFT sales issued by their respective guilds 

The benefit of holding these NFTs is reaping the recurring profit yields generated from the underlying business activities within these guilds 

DAO members who want to earn returns through their efforts can continue to contribute work in exchange for DAO governance tokens within the scope of these guilds. 

The value of these governance tokens issued are backed by the 20% carry the guilds impose on the recurring profits generated by these business activities.

[5/2/23, 8:39:47 AM] Gary Teh: I think this two tier model should cleanly demarcate the fiat funds injected by investors into various projects operated by our guilds and the governance tokens issued to DAO members in exchange for their time, effort and social capital contributions

The two key concerns we address are

1) how to raise external fiat funds while preventing purely profit focused and non-value aligned crypto whales (high networth individuals) from simply buying their way into our DAO governance tokens and compromising our DNA with the outsized voting weight they end up having through their raw purchasing power

2) the immediate dilutive effective whales experience on their capital when it gets injected directly via our governance tokens route. Buying at USD1 per governance token while cashing out from our DAO’s treasury at the current rate of USD0.0033 per governance token

[5/6/23, 7:12:50 AM] Gary Teh: Encountered this situation yesterday when I somehow ended up sharing about our DAO to an entire table of speakers at the cryptocurrency conference. 

They were all asking how to join the DAO. 

From my perspective rather than just lumping them all into the beer hall which is really a poor onboarding experience, it makes sense to have them just leave their email address on a waitlist along with their reason for interest and what skill sets they have 

That way we will selectively onboard them as and when roles open up that fit their skillset and motivation

The population growth rate of our DAO might end up being slower but the immediate engagement for newly onboarded members will be higher since the openings will be directly relevant and motivations aligned

This is aligned with what @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @5511982667030 have suggested 🙂👍
[8/26/23, 9:16:50 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. Hans Martin and the folks working on the ski equipment industry surfaced the same problem as well when we met up those two times in Davos. 

The original idea Hans Martin posited was to transition their supply chain to a circular economy and then tokenize the individual components. 

Unfortunately, after meeting up for two times months apart I figured that supply chain is very slow moving behemoth with lots of parts that required manufacturing. 

And that was when @971561302188 reached out with the problem of poverty in Africa. Her prompt inspired looking into applying the circular economy and tokenization to a supply chain that has less parts that required manufacturing 

A few months later@13134136108 jumped in with her fanatic love for cacao which tilted the direction for us to land on that produce during our poll

And here we are today 1 years and three months after the first meeting of the ski industry folks in Davos on the cusp on bringing in our first shipment of cacao nibs from South America into USA. 

If this project does prove successful, if anyone who criticizes that the WEF (world economic forum) in Davos is just all talk and no substantial outcome could be referred to the Agroverse project which idea was in Peter there. 🤣

[5/9/23, 3:31:51 PM] Gary Teh: We have managed to achieve a significant milestone today within the EcoVerse21 guild today by gaining full visibility into the end to end cost components required to finance the very first shipment of premium cacao from small-scale marginalized farmers in South America for resale to North American consumers. 

At a high level, the amount of assets within our treasury will be more than enough to cover all the required costing

Once the final figures are in, we should be expecting to hold a vote in treasury to release the assets required for its execution.

Executed successfully we should be expecting a significant jump in the assets under control in our treasury while benefiting these small scale marginalized farming communities 

We can then expect to continue ramping up the asset under control in our treasury via this route for the foreseeable future until market saturation in Northern America or until production capacity is achieved within these small scale farming communities.

We can then start expanding our guilds operations to support other communities that are focused on other agricultural produce.

[5/9/23, 3:46:22 PM] Gary Teh: Another key insight gained this week is that a lot of these small scale farms are ran by the aging elders. 

Their offsprings attracted by the allure of cities are opting instead to move to big cities seeking out minimum wage jobs. 

The younger generations once their parents choose to retire will opt to sell of these farms. 

This trend naturally segways into our sunmint project where we can opt to acquire these productive assets during such events.

Please let me know 🙂🙏
[5/11/23, 2:58:03 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, first we figure out and implement a system to pull in the resources in a self sustaining manner and then we channel the surplus resources towards improving overall infrastructure 

Right now what I observe is bulk of the solutions skirt pass the heavy lifting of tackling the legal, marketing and logistic hurdles. 

This leaves huge room for arbitrage and exploitation of producers and end consumers by middle men (the ones who tackled these hurdles by building a bridge and then charging a toll for its use with the goal of profit maximization ).

We build a bridge too. But with the goal of ironing out the asymmetry within the system. first we become the middle man and then from there we expand our bridge. 

Eventually we replace the bridges setup by other middle men.

I am aware there are members who are familiar with other trade routes and product types. 

We will reinvite them back into the guild once we have done a few iterations of transactions and are ready to expand to either more territories or product types. 

Meanwhile as we go through the current two iterations as and when there are other needs within the guild we will reach out to bring more members who fit the profile into the project🙂🙏

[5/15/23, 5:34:40 PM] Gary Teh: Folks the EcoVerse21 guild is looking for introductions to person of the following that you might be familiar 

- professional cacao taster
- US import broker 
- someone familiar with USFDA certification process
[8/31/23, 12:59:13 AM] Gary Teh: Doesn’t seem like what we need right now 

Let’s hold off on Q
[5/15/23, 7:20:21 PM] Gary Teh: Rubric adjustments has past within the governors’ committee

Please refer our latest updated rubric 

https://TrueSight.me/rubric 

Governance token Grants are now geared specifically to support the needs of existing projects in our DAO and less towards introducing new ideas/projects that are not related to what our guilds are working on. 

In order of priority 
- EcoVerse21 
- Sunmint
- Edgar

[8/31/23, 10:47:22 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we are done with the final portion of the FSVP (foreign supplier verification program) certification it has became evident that since we will be shifting a portion of our manufacturing (cacao nibs packing) process within the borders of USA, we will need to develope a food safety plan and good manufacturing practice policy to secure those sections of our supply chain 

To develop and implement that section of our supply chain we will need to engage the service of a PCQI (Preventive Control Qualified Individual) 

there are two possible options. 

Option 1) Hire one and pay him/her to draft it up once 

Option 2) build up  in-house capabilities by getting certified ourselves 

The latter route will allow us immense maneuverability later on as we configure and reconfigure on our shore supply chains by adding more and more decentralized nodes to our onshore USA food processing/manufacturing network.  

Let’s do a poll
[5/16/23, 12:14:40 PM] Gary Teh: Updates from the Ecoverse21 guild on our project's critical path:

1 - We have shortlisted 3 customs brokers based in San Francisco Bay Area to work with to handle the import. Following up with them on the paperwork needs. 
2 - Tomorrow we will follow up with a specialist consultant on FDA registration for our US legal entity
3 - Tomorrow we will look into getting our DUNS number for becoming an importer
4 - Will start discussion about warehousing details in Bay Area this Thursday
5 - Made arrangements to visit the CooP facility in Brazil as well as to sample their produce sometime next week
6 - awaiting confirmation from Ecuador supplier to visit their facility as well as to sample their produce
[8/31/23, 10:50:37 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
How shall we handle the need for a PCQI for our onshore compliance needs?
‎OPTION: Utilize a portion of the proceeds already released from our vault to hire a PCQI (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Acquire PCQI certification in house using proceeds already release from our vault (4 votes)
‎OPTION: Evangelize a new DAO member who is already PCQI certified to do it in exchange for governance tokens (0 votes)
[5/16/23, 1:44:38 PM] TUSHAR SHARMA: All the best 💯
[8/31/23, 10:51:54 AM] Gary Teh: The cheapest PCQI course to get certified  I found online was this one 

https://www.aibinternational.com/products/pcqi-online/

One way or the other we will need that certification as soon as the shipment of cacao nibs arrive in USA and we start repackaging it
[5/16/23, 2:12:19 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure we will get pass the road block you experienced the last time with your shipment of rice out of India

Once we have completed two successful iterations we will open up the guild to support imports from more countries and more SKUs and more DAO members sourcing for these SKUs.

There will be a standard operating procedure that members will need to follow when operating these export satellites. 

The tricky part is configuring the exporting companies to be compliant with the regulations of US

Which state to incorporate our LLC in?
‎OPTION: Delaware (2 votes)
‎OPTION: Nevada (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Wyoming (0 votes)
‎OPTION: New Mexico (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Texas (1 vote)
[8/31/23, 6:07:35 PM] Gary Teh: None
[5/17/23, 11:00:38 AM] Gary Teh: This is what ChatGpt has advised after being queried

Delaware: Delaware is a popular choice for incorporating businesses due to its well-established corporate law structure, business-friendly regulations, and specialized courts, such as the Court of Chancery, which handles corporate disputes. Delaware offers favorable tax laws for businesses and has a strong legal framework that provides clarity and predictability.

Nevada: Nevada is known for its business-friendly environment, including minimal reporting requirements, no state corporate income tax, and no personal income tax. It also provides strong asset protection laws, making it an attractive option for businesses.

Wyoming: Wyoming is another state with business-friendly regulations and low taxes. It offers advantages such as no state corporate income tax, low annual fees, strong privacy protections, and a simplified reporting process.

New Mexico: New Mexico is gaining popularity as a favorable state for LLC incorporation due to its low filing fees, no franchise tax, and a straightforward business formation process. It also offers a business-friendly environment and favorable tax laws.

Texas: Texas is known for its pro-business environment and has no personal income tax or state corporate income tax. It offers a favorable regulatory climate, access to a large market, and a strong economy.
[8/31/23, 7:24:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Pricey but probably worth it
[5/17/23, 11:23:12 AM] Tres Garcia: Can we take a quick inventory on the count of US and Foreign peeps that will be involved with the LLC? 

Why? 
Missing deadlines and not documenting non us owners will result in heafty fines for Delaware based co / LLC

Not sure how they view tokenization if it infers ownership of the Entity. 

TX has no tax as long as the DAO is under $1M in rev. 

De will be $300 per year + other fees pending the composition

[5/17/23, 11:40:35 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking if all the token holders should even be listed as directors or shareholders of the US based LLC. 
Perhaps only a subset of those actively involved in the guild.

I think the bulk of the financial plumbing work would be to figure out how the funds provided by the DAO to finance the shipment will be channeled back to it after the sales of the shipment is completed. And have it cleanly accounted for in the guild's LLC.

To keep things simple, perhaps to only have US based DAO members who plan to be really hands on and involved with the Ecoverse21 guild listed as directors of the LLC. 

Right now based on what I am observing that would only be me and @13134136108, unless some other US based members are willing to stepup.
[9/1/23, 8:01:43 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 yes can pick up.  But as I mentioned earlier edge and node have not confirmed that I can use the space. We are still in discussion
[5/17/23, 11:42:32 AM] Gary Teh: We have found our customs broker and FDA representative. The next step is to figure out our LLC entity. Once that is done, the rest will just start flowing really smoothly.
[9/1/23, 8:35:43 AM] Gary Teh: Had a 30 minutes FaceTime with @918017107841 yesterday

Item 1 - once we have written letter of assurance for FDA compliance from both the Brazilian and Ecuador supplies, we will utilize both articles to assemble a package to request for grants from the Ethereum foundation. Grants will be utilized to implement the FDA compliance verification process on chains

Item 2 - walk through Agroverse.shop experience. @918017107841 show cased the recipe submission form. @918017107841 was informed shopping cart checkout mechanism is now working

    - finalized and arranged the shipment of samples from Ecuador to our operating base in California
[5/17/23, 12:41:12 PM] Gary Teh: We will still need an LLC setup in the US to handle importing into the country.

[5/17/23, 1:02:21 PM] Gary Teh: Was chatting with @972509342179, to keep things simple for our first iteration and the DAO from being entangled in the US based LLC structure, members will just simply need to “trust” at face value the funds withdrawn from our vault to finance the first cacao shipment from Ecuador will be returned back to the next vault with the additional surpluses after deductions of all fees and US based taxation.

Should the agent handling the funds decides to abscond with it, then our DAO would have experienced our very first rug pull. 😱
[9/2/23, 6:52:42 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: What about community? There's unappraised value in that.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ZgY2Q18Ftw8B-yQlAbQhXwI3Dk_qCDbQgCbWuvwGa4/edit

That should help protect the DAO against a rug pull.

[5/18/23, 5:03:46 AM] Gary Teh: This is a great approach

This is how I am thinking of accounting for the flow of funds 

Whenever there is an incoming shipment the financing the DAO provides to the LLC is recorded as a personal loan on the balance sheet. 

Once transaction is finished loan amount is returned and the amount removed from the balance sheet

Profit (less taxes) is then used to purchased governance tokens from our DAO’s vault at the rate of USD1 to 1 governance token by the LLC. 

The side-effect though is the LLC end up accumulating a lot of voting power in our DAO overtime.

Anyone has a better idea?

[5/22/23, 4:04:04 AM] Gary Teh: Gentle reminder 

Please keep conversations not directly related to our DAO out of the town hall 🙂🙏

The beer hall is a great place to bring such discussions to.
[9/3/23, 7:34:15 AM] Gary Teh: Come the Autumn Equinox (22nd Sep 2023), the new set of governors will be rotated into position

*Current Policy*
    - *Parameter 1 - Total number of governors*: 10
    - *Parameter 2- Tenure*: 3 months
    - *Parameter 3 - Selection criteria*: top 10 contributors for past 90 days

Let's relook into how governors are selected, discuss and then agree upon a new set of policy (3 parameters) on how new governors should be selected (elected), thereafter vote this new policy into effect in our town hall.

We can consider additional parameters on top of the 3 existing ones.
[5/22/23, 4:07:23 AM] Gary Teh: Policies and guidelines for our chatrooms are documented here

[9/4/23, 4:45:44 PM] Gary Teh: Created the first draft of Agroverse technology solutions architecture. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.n1zi2ph05oau

As well as a more detailed documentation of the API end points that will be exposed via our server clusters (perhaps ran in our SunMint off-grid data center)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.ftxgqr5vdhij

Farmers/manufacturers are paid tokens whenever they conduct preventive control verification activities on chain. The value of these tokens will be backed by the profit from sales of their product in USA. 

This is even for farmers who we are not yet getting supplies from. Their adoption of the solution will just make it super easy for us to onboard them as foreign suppliers as they will become compliant with FSVP requirements as soon as they adopt our solution. This means we don't need to jump through as many hoops onboarding them.

PS: regarding the SunMint off grid data center, me and @16468233438 (perhaps Dean who built solar powered buggies for Burning Man) will experiment with implementing a fully solar powered prototype in @16468233438's backyard once I get back to California.

Once we have gotten FSVP compliance written assurance letter from the agriculture cooperative as well as proven the viability of our go to market with our very first batch of cacao nib sales we will compile the materials required to assemble a fundraising deck. We will approach the Ethereum foundation as well as social impact funds for financing to accelerate the build out of the prototype documented.

Needs 
——
    - find us more quotation from FSVP agents that we can choose from to optimize our import cost 

    - participants for our focus group
[9/7/23, 9:12:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Transit is intimidating in a new place.
[6/5/23, 1:42:26 PM] Gary Teh: DAO level needs

    - Verma has sent link to 2 related Refi projects that we could follow up with
        - https://ethereum.org/en/refi/ (for financing)

Your preferred structure for Agroverse (AGS) and fiat capital injection for it via TrueTech Inc (TTI)?
‎OPTION: TTI as holding bay for $. Governance tokens issued to TTI for expenses paid 4 AGI. AGI stays in DAO (2 votes)
‎OPTION: TTI as independent subsidiary running AGI. TTI shares issued to Swiss Association 4 DAO contrbutns (1 vote)
‎OPTION: TTI as independent subsidiary running AGI. TTI shares issued to investmnt syndicate 4 DAO contribtns (1 vote)
[9/8/23, 8:49:50 AM] Tomas - Offchain: True! That can be a call to action to sell

[9/8/23, 8:49:57 AM] Tomas - Offchain: I completely forgot about that
[6/12/23, 6:03:57 AM] Gary Teh: Side note: Folks who opt for option 2 are basically also volunteering to help setup the Swiss association that will be TrueSight DAO’s legal wrapper. 

Option 2 and 3 assumes Agroverse will be a brand under TrueTech Inc and TrueTech Inc is getting structured as a spin off and TrueSight DAO is one of the early investors in the Agroverse project. This route allows us seek capital raise via traditional financing methods (Angels, VCs…) once our initial pilot test proves successful. A whole bunch of full time staff will then be hired to operate the project thereafter.
[9/8/23, 8:49:59 AM] Tomas - Offchain: 🤣

Do let me know so that we can have those tokenized
[6/12/23, 6:18:19 AM] Gary Teh: Option 1 assumes profit generated via Agroverse operations will get channeled back to TrueSight DAO to back governance tokens value and provide liquidity as and when DAO member wishes to cash out the governance tokens for fiat or when new project passing through our DAO requires resource backing. 

Option 2 and 3 assumes profit generated within TrueTech Inc will continue to stay within company for continued business operations and scaling. Value of governance tokens will be backed by shares in TrueTech Inc. There will be no liquidity for governance tokens until such a liquidity event such as TrueTech Inc gets acquired or goes for IPO. New projects passing through TrueSight DAO that requires resource backing will not benefit from the liquidity sitting within TrueTech Inc.

Rather than allowing V directly into our ecosystem, he was kept in a holding bay 

He was only allowed entry into our beer hall after we have had an interview with him and ascertained he is of value to our DAO 

Only then was he allowed into our beer hall

At which point he had already made some contributions to our DAO

Checking with @18298364965 now to figure out when he might be available to head over there together. In worst case scenario (his day to day schedule operating the hotel is very demanding), I will figure out the logistics to get there

    - @972543523823 has came up with a draft of our package design. She is now modifying the designs to fit the required physical dimensions 

    - I have acquired enough information to draft up the financials for our first 100KG pilot test as well as the economics for each 1000KG of cacao shipment.


Main DAO

    - had a chat with @33652866472 today. The folks from Peace on Snow Associations have responded. Apparently Hans Martin whom I visited during my recent trip to Switzerland is one of the founding members. I have since started the conversation with them.

    - there is right now an ongoing private side discussions about a new potential project amongst various DAO members that is focused on addressing the social injustice within the hospitality industry. Discussion are still in the early stages to figure out which partners fit where and how TrueSight DAO might fit in. We will be deliberate and proceed with care so as to avoid committing the same mistake we did with Peter Peng. 

Peter Peng (an ex-member booted from our eco-system) came into our DAO, utilized our collective brain cycles to help refine his AI idea thereafter claimed it fully as his own. Renumeration for usage brain cycles within our DAO was not properly accounted for. Brain cycles of DAO members were consumed but in exchange there were no boost to the net book value of our governance tokens. 🤔
[9/10/23, 6:32:18 AM] Suheil - Europe: starting to play around --> https://www.instagram.com/p/CxA03YkMXP2/ 

to be continued... 

Meanwhile, we need dao members to follow and like the Instagram page. 

Any members who is "IN" in being engaged to help us push organic (by giving us couple of minutes of their time to share/like/comment social posts) please raise your hand

example of organic trick : 
- imagine the results if, for this post ,we tag like X amount  of members and each re share from their profile.

If u cant imagine, i can tell you from experience , results come in BIG :)
[6/21/23, 4:50:58 AM] Tiff Tiff: Also the suggestion of Danielle Sunberg as beverage distribution advisor
[9/10/23, 6:42:21 AM] Suheil - Europe: Target: 
- 3/4 posts,stories, reels  a week 
- 1-2 interviews a week ( with farmers, dao members etc..)

We might need to open a specialized guild for PR and marketing as coordination and consistency is one of the most critical points for successful long-term goals... 

it is not about making Instagram posts only. 

we need to plan: podcasts, social strategies, mini documentaries, press, a lot of production involved... unfortunately this part is not doable in a "decentralized manner"  and we need to act like a traditional company team with same level of commitment :)

    - Followed up with @447887692903 and Marie to proposed next stepson a second set of logo, packaging and website designs. Once both sets are really, very likely we will submit them here for voting by DAO members

    - Followed up with President of Brazilian Cooperative to find out about their documentation status

    - Completed 5 year financial projections of Agroverse cacao nibs SKU and its net impact on our DAO's governance token net book value

    - @17782305576 is follow up to get contact details of lab testing facility in USA

[6/21/23, 3:15:37 PM] Gary Teh: This growth trajectory also does not take into account the other SKUs that we will import from the cooperatives that we have setup relationships with. 

Some of the RnD I observe done at the grassroot level is just amazing. The other day, me and @18298364965 had the opportunity to taste wine made from Cacao! It tasted like elixir. 

From my perspective, that will be one of the very very next SKUs, we want to carry once the organic cacao nibs and ceremonial cacao trade routes have been established.

Agroverse
----
    - Visited Abel from Conacado cooperative and obtained samples (Gary & @18298364965 )
    - Gotten quotation from testing labs for doing testing (@17782305576)

Main DAO
----
    - 7 day voting process in progress in the governance committee about adopting motion for Swiss Association
    - 7 day voting process in progress in the governance committee on deprecation of 6 inactive chatrooms within our DAO 
    - 7 day voting process in progress on inclusion of new chatroom focused on the hospitality industry
[9/12/23, 8:50:17 AM] Gary Teh: Scheduled a meeting with Derrek from the engineering guild and @31641075825 to chat this coming Friday

*Scope of discussion*
    1. - train ChatGpt with our historical data recorded on our ledger
    2. - streamline our ledger update by automating the classification of incoming DAO member contributions
    3. - expected output of this standalone initiative
    
*Purpose*
    1. mitigate against trigger of unofficial KILL SWITCH in the event no one knows up to update the ledger anymore after Gary gets KIA (killed in action) during one of our DAO quests by being shot with a gun or stabbed with a proper knife.

    2. replace human and have AI as the independent unbiased judge

    3. further the manifesto of the Do Nothing society.
[6/23/23, 5:11:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: I got a question. Been reading some of ur good work on this Agro verse. 

Well done Gary. 

But I don’t really get it. It’s coco nibs. It’s organic. It’s everywhere in my supermarket. 

So what’s the unique selling point?

[9/12/23, 6:30:26 PM] Gary Teh: At this point, since we are a DAO (everyone has governance voting rights) , let’s invite some thoughts on the table to discuss about possible action plan moving forward given this new set of information

Thereafter we add/adjust/remove milestone items on the Agroverse whitepaper

[6/23/23, 5:17:22 PM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: Supports small farmers.

[9/12/23, 8:03:45 PM] Val Lapidus: So the only thing that changes from our original plan is that we aren't paying the co-op in DAO tokens?
[6/23/23, 5:29:15 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: and who will be in the ado Switzerland side?
[9/12/23, 8:24:02 PM] Gary Teh: Actually nothing changed at all from the current execution perspective 

We are just not going to focus our attention on building a cacao futures trading platform as some has mentioned might be an option further down the road 

One potential concern is that if all the cacao farmers pre sold their cacao on that platform we might end up not having any supplies to sell when we do ramps up our distribution effort on the USA side
[6/23/23, 5:31:19 PM] Gary Teh: During my meeting with @12023686334 yesterday. It seems if you just look at the product itself, it's technically just a generic commodity.

But as @573136732781 has just shared and @41765737357 has emphasized over and over again during our conversations, the pandemic has caused a shift in consumer attitude.

They are looking increasingly beyond the commodity aspects of a product they consume on a daily basis. Increasingly they are concern about the story behind the product. 

- are the people who produced the product being treated fairly?
- what are the day to day struggles the people producing the product face (climate change impact)?
- Is the process used to produce the product environmentally sustainable?
[9/12/23, 8:27:42 PM] Gary Teh: Once we ramp up our US based distribution volume and when we do roll out the mobile based FSVP verification process later on, they will forced to adopt it anyways because of FDA compliance requirements

So no big deal on the adoption front
[6/23/23, 5:34:50 PM] Gary Teh: If the proposal gets adopted, then the current set of governors (past 90 top 10 contributors in our DAO) being nominated by our system will be asked if they are able and willing to contributed at the level required as documented in the proposal.

For those that are not, we will source for people who are able to contribute at the required capacity in the following order as nominated by our system

    - 180 days top 10 contributors
    - 360 days top 10 contributors
    - all time top 10 contributors
[9/12/23, 9:38:08 PM] Anupa/diya: I think that someone was me. If Mathew has said that they are partnering with another company to do the same thing . Then making two products of the same purpose is pointless.

We can maybe capitilise on it as a buy in to the agroverse community. Maybe

*key outputs*
    - captured video footages requested by @918017107841 
    - updated and completed written assurance letter for FDA FSVP compliance 
    - conducted tasting session with cooperatives members using six samples brought. Sample #6 was strongest contestant. 

*follow up*
    - visit cacao innovation center (CIC) where independent quality assurance certification is issued 

    - visit facilities that will be processing our shipment of cacao nibs 

    - get sample of cacao nibs matching closely to taste profile of sample #6

    - arranging to attend cacao ceremony before my departure 

    - visiting sabrae office to follow up with flight ticket for @5511982667030
[6/23/23, 5:38:06 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: easy and not that expensive to show this story whit a professional vidomaker in the social media marketing in the right market whit high visibility, maybe whit a present in a special  day like the day of the heart, san Valentinos day,christmas and bla bra. Everything connected whit a good brand design and a good shipping Amazon fba selling mode over then the sell in the normal market.
‎[9/13/23, 11:07:49 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[6/23/23, 5:39:46 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Using Amazon FBA selling model and then sell in the normal market is the same order that both @31641075825 and @12023686334 proposed.
[9/13/23, 2:29:16 PM] Gary Teh: We got their DUNS number!! 🤩

*up next*
- Conduct final focus group with the sample they will pass us 

- register their faciiity with FDA using DUNs number 

- send them the Purchase order as soon as we are done 

- await shipment in San Francisco airport
[6/23/23, 5:42:49 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: ye the unicity will be a mix from brand design and quality of the product.

[6/23/23, 6:10:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: My chime in is this. 

For you to launch a common product which in my supermarkets has many organic sources. Their labels probably will have sustainable type writing. 

You are basically selling the STORY. 

So hence from a sales person perspective. 

Your focus needs to be finding ambassadors to sell story. Some sort of viral marketing. Some sort of influencer thingy. 

Don’t expect to slap on sustainable, ESG. Organic Some farmer story on a label and expect it to sell. 

Unless your price is cheapest amongst all the organic items. 

Unless there is distinct taste advantage. 

Otherwise. You will get initial sales for the novelty. Then it will fizzle out. 

These days. The market is too saturated with the word Organic. Home grown. Local farmers. It’s been overused and consumers are very numb to it.
[9/14/23, 4:12:43 AM] Gary Teh: Bump
[6/23/23, 6:12:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hence in sort. If you do not have a superior taste difference. Or price difference. 

Concentrate on marketing the story. Not the product.

[6/23/23, 6:13:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: Use the DAO itself to create hype
[9/14/23, 6:43:51 AM] Gary Teh: Moving forward, since DAO is not charging for the cacao nib samples when DAO members request them from our very limited supply, we should define clearly what we will expect in return for shipping them over. 

I feel the required reciprocal action should be something that will help move Agroverse project forward. 

As @5511982667030 suggested before, every action must necessarily enable more resources and more actions within our DAO. 

Otherwise we are not being accountable and just simply depleting DAO resources without necessarily advancing our mission. 

(PS: I still feel having the Kill Switch in place is the most effective method to focus everybody’s attention on what is important)

Let’s discuss. 🙂🙏
[6/23/23, 6:13:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: Showcase the product born of collaboration

[6/23/23, 6:15:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tell the world farmers get directly tokens and hence product sales directly raises income of the farmers. 

Then set ablaze a decentralised farmer movement. 

If it takes off. You can create a branding for it

[9/14/23, 8:54:02 AM] Anupa/diya: I think we need a map that will show the resources we need to make profit against the DAO s treasury. We need to make predictions so we can see if we need to go to the kill switch. If so, then we should abort shortly if we cannot be sustainable. There is no point to linger. 

However, if we continue I think we should find ways of means to sustain since the efforts are immense.I feel agroverse can help gain funding and find sustainability. We can maybe only work with AgroVerse now

[9/14/23, 7:04:54 PM] Gary Teh: The Zero to One problem when it comes to go to market strategies is their lack of predictability. You will only know how effective each proposed strategy is only after resources are deployed to execute the initial iteration

Even @381642051030 mentioned this during our FaceTime the last time 

In terms of fiat resources We have USD5000++
[6/25/23, 5:52:38 PM] Gary Teh: The signals from what I gather when conversing privately with long time contributors like @16468233438 @5511982667030 @18175503434 @6596983014 @6594897484 and @48606646246, is that ideally we arrive at something tangible. Tangible means tokens they acquired via their contributions could sooner rather than later be exchanged for resources that could be used to feed their families. 

Be at peace that I am very well aware of these needs various DAO members with differing financial background have when assessing the various opportunities that come our way and helping prioritize as according.
[9/14/23, 7:08:14 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time value management - kill switch - opportunity cost on micro tasking level, hold each dao member accountable for inputs and outputs. Would be a challenge to draft the methodology and automate it.

[9/14/23, 7:42:13 PM] Gary Teh: I remember having a conversation where Brian talked about the value of time prior to us raising Series A for disconnect Inc 

Prior to product market fit, You want to be as aggressive as possible time wise in the deployment of funds by ploughing through and validating your stack of hypothesis ASAP once financing becomes available and not get distracted by anything else not on the critical path. 

If all the hypothesis don’t work you know you have a dud, you can quickly free up your time and move on to more promising opportunities.

[6/26/23, 5:26:40 AM] Jonathan: The question is what needs to be onchain? If not much ethereum is good but the fees will kill the business if a lot of transactions going on
[9/14/23, 7:45:02 PM] Gary Teh: Are you proposing that DAO members who want to continue maintaining access to our town hall stake 90% of the governance token holdings in our vault?? 🤣
[6/26/23, 5:29:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: All are like this . They are seeking high volumes and care the less about low quality volume
[9/14/23, 7:47:25 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That could be an option and provide a tiered system for the access to the town hall
[6/26/23, 5:29:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: They all compete on size of network in a "let's go fast " model
[9/14/23, 7:47:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time sensitive of course

[9/14/23, 7:48:26 PM] Vlatko Gigov: To get access to the yield generated from dao activities you need to stake min x tokens.
[6/26/23, 6:35:13 AM] Gary Teh: Here are a few recurring transactions I have in mind

Main DAO
———
- Voting and management of treasury funds 

- Issue of governance tokens from our vault for contributions made by DAO members


Agroverse
——
- [potential] DAO member submits shipment financing request by providing all necessary details including wallet address of the human agent who will be handling the transaction offline 

- [potential] DAO votes to determine if shipment financing request should pass and minting of Agroverse shipment NFTs  for this shipment financing request enabled


- [potential] issue and minting of Agroverse Shipment NFTs to finance shipment of cargos to USA for sale by interested supporters

- [potential] DAO voting to determine how many percent of Agroverse profit proceeds should go to Agroverse shipment NFT holders 

- [potential] DAO voting to determine how many percent of Agroverse profit proceeds should go to DAO treasury

- [potential] Agroverse shipment NFT holders to vote on how many percent of their profit proceeds should be channeled to farmers the shipment was sourced from 



The bulk of the transactions for the Main DAO will be via the vault solution that already exist 


The entirety of the transactions for the Agroverse transactions will be encapsulated in the DApp that folks at the hackathon Suheil will be organizing will be building
[9/14/23, 7:49:48 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Puts upwards pressure (buy-in) on the token value if let’s say initiatives like agroverse are successful.
[6/26/23, 6:39:16 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective all these are just really interim bootstrapping solutions 

once volume gets larger for the shipments we will just migrate all these to our own chain - TrueChain

TrueChain is going to be EVM compatible 

And the miners/validators will be mainly ran by the farmers/cooperatives. Bulk of them already utilize solar panels to power the facilities 

This will provide them with an additional source of revenue (in the form of gas fees) to tide through times when harvest are negatively impacted by climate
[9/14/23, 7:51:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: And from there onwards you implement the tiered system based on the rubrics and different initiatives.

[6/26/23, 7:39:49 AM] Gary Teh: The reason we are conducting this exercise is because there will be an upcoming vote happening directly on our vault to release USD850 to @12023686334 

USD600 will be utilized by @12023686334 to pay for the USA Trade Mark Registration for Agroverse. We will need to registration ID before Amazon will unlock our Amazon Seller Profile page

USD250 will be utilized by @12023686334 to procure GS1 barcodes which we will need visible on our packaging and transportation boxes when they arrive in the USA

[6/26/23, 9:27:41 AM] Tres Garcia: Is there a TLDR for why you want to change layer 1?

SOL = fastest and cheapest. 
ETH = dependable but expensive. 

If agroverse is recording transactions. It may become too expensive to record on ETH vs sol.
[9/15/23, 5:58:26 AM] Gary Teh: concluded 30 minutes FaceTime meeting with @5511982667030 

*key follow ups*
Item 1 - follow up with orlantildes to discuss and agree on the process we will use to control the threshold for the taste variance of cacao nibs shipped to USA once we lock down on the taste

Item 2 - get Orlantildes to make an introduction to Tasuijio whom they are working with to issue the cacao coin so that I could understand where he is planning to go with the technology. Explore how we could tap into it later on

Item 3 - research how mini premium chocolate gifts are presented in Whole Foods USA. Orlantildes gave samples of cacao coated almonds which could have market potential in USA
[6/26/23, 9:28:39 AM] Tres Garcia: You will need a layer 2 to manage bulk transactions (polygon / MATIC). So just stick with the dater layer 1

[6/26/23, 1:54:30 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, it’s mainly where the critical mass of blockchain developers are and where the liquidity is aggregated around 

The qualitative signal I am getting from @41799155602 and @31641075825 is that energy level of the people behind this chain is waning. This could infer that population growth rates of developer in that ecosystem will likely stagnate if not drop. Feel free to counter me

Meanwhile seems EVM variants are increasingly gaining more and more critical mass

Liquidity wise, if Agroverse is going to allow the minting of Shipment financing NFTs it makes sense to utilize the chain that had the most liquidity. Hence my thoughts of utilizing Ethereum chain and Tezos chain for that. 

(If we do go down the route of the shipment financing NFTs for Agroverse) Since the funds generated from their minting is not going to be staying onchain but actually utilized Off Chain, the actual smart contracts of blockchain is not really useful. 

What we will really end up needing is an actual legal contract based in the USA that states the person receiving the funds generated via the minting actually go ahead and execute what is promised off line (take the money to pay the cooperatives and vendors to get the shipment into the USA for sale) otherwise get sued by our legal entity in USA. The big question is is that even legally enforceable in the USA courts

[9/15/23, 10:24:18 AM] Gary Teh: - @41799155602 is familiar with handling imports for Switzerland

- @41796560010 is providing warehousing facility  

- person who is familiar with handling packing cacao nibs in Switzerland is missing

- person handling fulfillment when customer request comes in is missing

[9/15/23, 10:26:08 AM] Iwona Fluda: They don’t do the fancy packing for the products themselves, but if the products will be shipped in small e.g. envelops, we can make the magic happen.
[6/26/23, 4:09:52 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is if both @41799155602 and @31641075825 reached out to them and they both got ignored then I doubt the other developers in the ecosystem would have any better experience dealing with them. And it’s not like @41799155602 and @31641075825 are nobodies in the ecosystem. 

@41799155602 literally sits on the satoshi round table

And until now our exchange rate pair submitted to serum is not even listed

Last time when I was in Germany at the conference that @491736386942 organized and mentioned this problem to the Solana folks there they just shrugged their shoulders and said they can’t do anything about it

How much retention do you think a generally centralized chain like theirs can have on the developers if the user experience is just shit. 🤔
[9/15/23, 10:27:49 AM] Gary Teh: If we shipped you the already printed Kraft pouches would you be able to put 227grams of cacao nibs on each before you ship them out to somewhere In Europe?
[6/26/23, 4:52:41 PM] Gary Teh: And then you take a step back and objectively observe the second order dynamic that is playing out right now in our DAO because of the three first order interactions 3 DAO members have, and if extrapolate this pattern to what is potentially playing out in other communities right now regarding Solana, can’t that be inferred as a negative virality and thus negative network effect playing out which could potentially lead to accelerate churn in the ecosystem? 🤔
[9/15/23, 10:27:59 AM] Gary Teh: 227grams = 8 ounces

Should DAO attempt to utilize any of this managed inventory for focus group purposes or recipe RnD, DAO will need to purchase the inventory from the financiers

Purchase price of inventory from the financiers will be at the rate of *cost plus standard rate markup*. 

Payment to financier can be made in fiat or governance tokens depending on the preference of the financier. Financier can exercise the right not to sell to DAO.

[6/28/23, 4:43:54 PM] Vlatko Gigov: At some stage we definitely should. It will cost us/them a fraction to bank on the upside and protect the downside. 

I doubt they are familiar, but I’m sure their chain of clients are.

It depends on the quantity we can gather and the type of commodity to be delivered: cocoa vs. cacao…

[6/28/23, 7:53:15 PM] Gary Teh: I observed that folks undertaking tasks will on occasions be caught up and occupied with other matters in their personal life and work life. We are a DAO and Autonomy is one of our core values. Contribution is strictly voluntary. This phenomena should be embraced. 

However the downside effect is visibility on when something gets completed is non-existent. Members undertaking tasks further down the critical path gets blocked. Dysfunction starts spreading across our entire DAO. Members start getting frustrated and churning.

I was discussing this issue with @5511982667030 just now during our facetime. She proposed that we adopt this protocol, which makes a lot of sense to me. 

Here is how it works:
----
When a DAO member decides to undertake a certain tasks, the DAO member must clearly state deadline beyond which the item will get delivered. And if no deadline is clearly stated, guild leader should prompt DAO member for one before undertaking is allowed to begin. 

In the event, task is delivered before deadline, tasks comes to an end.

Should task not be delivered when deadline arrives, DAO member can either self declare a new deadline or if not, the guild leader will reach out to get a new commitment from DAO member. 

DAO member can also choose to indicate that he/she has decided to abandon the task, at which point the tasks is freed up for undertaking by other DAO members.

Should DAO member not respond when prompted for a deadline by which to commit to, it will be assumed by default DAO member has abandoned tasks with a 48 hour period. Guild leader or other DAO members can have tasks reassigned.

[7/6/23, 1:06:40 PM] Gary Teh: Voting is now available for governance token holders to indicate their preferred rate. 

A DAO wide standard rate is computed based on preferred rates submitted. It indicates the transaction fee that will be applied to transactions made across our network of businesses. 

https://truesight.me/dao/preferred-rate

Right now, it is applicable for the following use cases:

    - markup on cost of goods for the cacao supplies which we will be selling to @573136732781which she will need for her cacao ceremonies

    - transactions fees we will be charging on the interest rate for facilitating a business loan proposal bearing a 12% interest that @554792626338 is right now surfacing for discussions in the governance channel

    - percentage of the net profit we will set aside for ourselves for each shipment sold via Amazon by our DAO to back the value of our governance token for each new shipment of cacao if the shipment is fully financed by us (the rest of which will be set aside as an budget to support ESG initiatives proposed by the Cooperatives)

    - percentage of the net profit we will set aside for ourselves for each shipment sold via Amazon by our DAO to back the value of our governance token for each new shipment of cacao if the shipment is fully financed by a third party financier via the Shipment financing NFT

1 for Ecuador and the other for Brazil and get @972543523823 help to update our package design 

There after we will obtain final quotation of pricing from both sources 

With these information at had we will have a final decision of which one we will prioritize for our initial shipment 

The USD3000 being released from our vault only allow us the ability to engage with supplies from one supplier through the service of Ken Lehay

[7/9/23, 11:21:15 AM] Gary Teh: It is clear that we will be pursuing a direct to consumer distribution model with our packaged products via our Agroverse project.

As initially suggested by @12023686334, we should also consider a distribution model for unpackaged raw materials to retailers who will repackage it for their own end consumers. @573136732781 from my perspective falls squarely into that demographic 

Profit margin for our DAO will be lower for the second distribution model but inventory holding cost and distribution cost we incur will be also lower. 

I suggest we have a poll to decide whether we should support this second distribution model for unsolicited retailers who approach us directly.

Key bottlenecks of scaling DAO 

    - information efficiency (not knowing enough for individual dao member to make an independent decision) 

    - feeling of psychological safety (fear of making the wrong decision) 

*Proposed rectification*
    - record and transcribe all conversations that ever occur within our DAO

    - feed transcriptions and chat data to LLM (AI)

    - in case of doubt, DAO member can ask LLM (AI) for clarification since it has full context if everything that is going on within DAO
[7/11/23, 6:40:09 PM] Gary Teh: Received a bunch of feedbacks today about new project proposal process. Also made some observations the past two months about this aspects of our DAO's operation.

[7/15/23, 9:54:32 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the underlying signal surfaced via all the incoming messages from the following DAO members over these past few weeks regarding the Agroverse project

@6590995199 @16468233438 @5511982667030 @573136732781 @12023686334 

The signals are all pointing in the same direction. Now that we can cleared off a huge portion of the ambiguity associated with the legal and logistic aspects of the project, conducting a focus group with our primary target audience (people consuming cacao nibs for their keto diet) becomes absolutely critical.

Amongst other things, one of the key insights I am hoping to glean from the focus group is to figure out how strongly these folks actually care about environmental sustainability. Quantitative signals I have gathered so far via analysis of Amazon reviews just seems to signal self interest as the main driver for sales as opposed to human altruism.

And here is where I see the divide. Internally amongst members of our DAO, altruism seems to be a recurring theme occupying a significant bandwidth of whats being discussed. Honestly, I doubt much of the folks here in this channel would really buy and consume cacao on a regular basis just because you want to be a responsible global citizen. 

So folks contributing to help build the Agroverse project and folks who end up consuming the cacao products really belong to two very different and distinct demographics.

[7/16/23, 5:30:33 AM] Gary Teh: Honestly speaking, even when I taste tested the roasted poultry my parents’ business have been distributing in Singapore for around 4 decades, the differences between their product and their competitors product as well as all the others I came across when I was traveling the world, the difference are so slight you can’t really tell the difference as a regular consumer with generally undeveloped taste buds. Of course there were some that were so bad I literally just walk out of the restaurant after sampling a few pieces. 

The same thing is true for all the sushi and ramen restaurants I have been sample around the world.

It’s just mind boggling how parent’s business managed to survive and remain one of the three companies standing in that small market place in Clementi Singapore which started with 23 competing stores after 40 years.

Mum was saying she did a lot of RnD on their original recipe by taste testing all the produce of the competitors around the entire Singapore on the weekends while they were not working. 

Dad was saying how they build relationships with the random folks walking pass their stores in the market place over time. Some of these consumers eventually turned into corporate customers. And these companies kept on with their recurring orders even years after his retirement 

One key insight he gave was that customer of another brand will only consider a “test” switch when the current brand’s inventory is not available or failed at a specific customer service requirement. 

And if the “test” switch is successful then the customer is unlikely to return until another of these inflection events occur 

What I noticed when studying the market segment on Amazon is that inventory of competitors are not always available for sale.

So these type of “test” switch situations will occur more frequently than usual. 

So if price is kept on par, the more convenient it is in terms of waiting time before receiving their products, the more likely a “test” switch occur. 

At that point, it’s just to habitually retain these new “switchers”

We should also narrow down on the target user ..

Are we looking price and taste led user or the ones that ethically and more organically driven because the narrative will be driven? 

Should we look at doing the quick focus group just to validate our insights

[7/16/23, 3:23:47 PM] Gary Teh: These are the objective attributes that I noticed my brain used to identify whether I like a variant versus another during my taste testing of the cacao nibs

    - the size of the chunks
    - how dark the cacao nibs appeared
    - the strength of the fragrance when I first opened the package
    - the sound of crunch
    - the initial bliss point which gets triggered in the brain due to sudden release of dopamine. 
        - If you were ever a smoker the experience is quite similar to your very first puff after a long long time
            - (sense of hearing) the crackling sound a nicely dried cigarette makes when you make your first draw after lighting it up
            - (sense of smell) the fragrance that hits nostril after the first puff
            - (dopamine release) the initial high which can get so giddy you almost can't stand on your feet when that very major dose of dopamine gets released from your brain into your blood stream

    - the length of time the fragrance lingers in my nose after I finished chewing and swallowing the cacao nibs
    - the bitterness of the after taste
[9/28/23, 11:50:19 AM] Gary Teh: I observe that new members usually feel very enthusiastic during the initial honey moon phase and would outperform in terms of contribution during the initial 90 days and sometimes end up as governors

However beyond the initial 90 day period, their enthusiasm would wane and they lost their qualifications as governors. 

To help our system select of governors who exhibit more consistency overtime, I would like to propose that during each of the quarterly seasonal rotation we pick the top 10 contributors over the past 180 days instead of the top 90 days. 

Let's submit this to a voting process and following this outcome as the new rule in the next seasonal rotation.

[7/16/23, 3:35:31 PM] Gary Teh: When I checked the source printed on the packaging labels of the other competitors, seems the Peruvian variant is what most USA sellers are offering.

[7/16/23, 3:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: In my head, tobacco, coffee, wine and cacao, they all belong in the same category due to the pathways via our five senses they utilize to trigger the release of dopamine during the very first time they are consumed over the course of the day.
[9/28/23, 4:08:53 PM] Val Lapidus: what's TDG?
[7/16/23, 3:55:49 PM] Gary Teh: If I imagined myself back on the keto diet which I had been on for an entire year, I wouldn't use tobacco and wine because they would mess around with my body chemistry which is very important for keto diet.

Coffee is boring since everyone is already doing it. Bullet Proof coffee has been around for years.

Cacao seems like the right kind of "prop" to use if you are within the keto social circles and want to make a strong first impression. Its like how the "cool" kids in the Bay Area were smoking marijuanna before it got legalized in the USA. 

Nowadays the "cool" kids have moved on to magic mushrooms. I would imagine once everyone else starts using magic mushrooms, the "cool" kids will move on to amanita muscaria

During the interview process 5 members from the engineering team would be involved and the final person conducting the interview was the CEO to determine cultural fit. 

The hiring committee would then convene to give either the thumbs up or thumbs down.

[10/1/23, 6:26:10 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't understand why we are discussing deprecating a channel, I get that their action is not cool, but it's not a reason to kill a channel.
[7/17/23, 8:55:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/1/23, 6:54:42 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the reason is because bulk of the engineering work right now is already taking place in @120363029205885187@g.us under @15419086904 leadership

The only reason the Engineering channel was kept there (apart from legacy reasons) was because there is a potential experimental engineering undertaking that Derek (the Hero) was going to do. And it was a good idea not to clobber communications between these two projects into one channel

But since Derek has dropped out, makes a lot of sense to just drop that channel and free up slots

We will get around to that scope that Derek was going to undertake eventually but meanwhile we will just manually update our ledger. What he was going to do is not on our critical path anyways. 

I was just testing his level of commitment to our mission with a simple ask ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 7:17:17 PM] Anupa/diya: One of the main things for the website is to build an end to end experience for the DAO. There is no point for the website to function as an information site. A current or potential member has to have the ability to interact and engage once they know what the site offers.

It's been build in what the user gets 
1. Awareness 
2. Engagement 
3.Interaction

Adding the ledger and token visibility is important is a key part of the experience.

The website is moving at a much faster speed with us collectively working on it. Eventually the original trusight will be clubbed with what is being created now.

[7/17/23, 9:41:03 PM] Gary Teh: boosting the percentage of fat in your diet has the counter-intuitive effect of causing your body's fat percentage to drop. Since below a certain level of sugar in your bloodstream your body enters into ketosis.

Oleic acid also possesses antioxidant properties and can fight free radicals.

It can strengthen cell membrane integrity, boost memory power, improve the functioning of the heart, circulatory system, and brain, increase energy levels, help with weight loss, reduce inflammatory conditions like arthritis, help to moisturize the skin and more.

‎[10/4/23, 9:43:31 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/17/23, 10:10:31 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. This scenario has been catered for in our rubric 

https://TrueSight.me/rubric
[10/4/23, 9:53:50 AM] Anupa/diya: I remember this conversation we had @Gary. 

As a collective strategy _ before we reach the actualization _ there are some things that individuals need to align with 

There is 
Needs and Wants
Alignment and Purpose 
Self motivation 
Self Awareness
Which eventually leads to the collective approach 

We have to be transperant about  about the fact that when someone joins this DAO, it is almost a Self initiated journey which adds to the DAO s purpose. The  incentivisation is immediate (governance tokens) but the benefit follows later (value). Every one wears a founders hat
[7/17/23, 10:11:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ok. Then
‎[10/4/23, 10:19:02 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/17/23, 10:14:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Let me get this right first. 

Problems
1) you don’t have economics of scale. Hence you cannot sell things for cheap. Because there is no way you can get operating cost down low enough to increase your profit margins. 

HENCE by giving it at a generally accepted price. Means you are handicapping yourself. Immediately. Because you are competing with people who has economics of scale.
[10/4/23, 10:20:53 AM] Anupa/diya: I firmly believe that this is a question that even current DAO members need to ask them selves if this aligns with them or not.
[7/17/23, 10:16:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2) taste testing as you mentioned has hardly any discernible difference. Hence you will not able to bait a switch of product brand from existing users. 

So all the taste comparisons. Don’t waste time on it. So long as our nibs taste good enough. That is taken care by it self. 

Plus tasting bags of nibs and having focus groups asking people to taste the difference is just waste of time.
‎[10/4/23, 10:22:01 AM] Gary Teh: ‎GIF omitted
[7/17/23, 10:17:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: 3) as you identified. The feature you want to sell most is the experience. The story behind the product. 

The problem then becomes marketing. How are you going to sell the story to vast amounts of people. Not only that. Make it viral
[10/4/23, 10:22:35 AM] Anupa/diya: We need to fine tune the metagame and add the details to the website
[7/17/23, 10:18:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: Is this so far correct?
[10/4/23, 10:23:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Each self journey will have its own path. At times it will align with Daos and at times not.
[7/17/23, 10:18:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: From what I have read in your threads
[10/4/23, 10:24:01 AM] Anupa/diya: There will be a space for all kinds of Members
[7/17/23, 10:19:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: So then. The solution to your problems is actually here.

[7/17/23, 10:19:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: One common strategy. 

They are all MLM type sales.

[7/17/23, 10:20:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: 1) sell it more expensive than the others with a large percentage of profit to your sales people as commission via a MLM tiering structure. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/17/23, 10:22:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2) since it’s a story driven product. You need people to tell your story. Hence MLM tiering sales relies heavily on incentivising people to capture the attention of other people. 

Each person receiving commissions will share their story of the cacao to sell more product. 

To recruit more people to sell your product
‎[10/4/23, 2:10:18 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/17/23, 10:24:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: 3) this way you avoid huge media related marketing cost. Your marketing cost will narrow down to a good website. A good MLM sales tracking system. A good trainer to create stories for your sales people to sell. 

The rest is up to your sales people who works purely on their own commission to share their stories. Hence no basic salary. No initial cost. 

The benefits of MLM are you tend to attract highly ambitious and money hungry people. You then have aggressive or highly initiative type sales
[10/4/23, 2:56:38 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/17/23, 10:26:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: 4) meanwhile whilst you are going through the forest. Self film your journey. From its origins. To show why it is differently grown than others. 

Then show the end benefits. Have a nutritionist analyse the product. And highly successful people who use the ritual to create the story of how it helps them do what they do. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/17/23, 10:28:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: So hence. This is the overall strategy

1) cheap
2) self hiring self viral sale people
3) low initial cost and yet high story telling.
[10/5/23, 10:33:07 AM] Gary Teh: Wire transfer of USD700 completed. 
Deducting USD40 transaction fee charged by Wells Fargo bank from our off chain balance.
[7/17/23, 10:29:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Now let’s compare the other types of strategy

1) place on a supermarket shelf?
- nobody will read your labels and stories. High competition. No differentiation captured within the first 5 seconds. 

2) rely on a good website?
- high marketing cost to get people to visit it. And then subsequently getting them sold on the story
‎[10/5/23, 4:08:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/17/23, 10:31:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Your business my friend. 

Is not a product business. 

It’s a story business 

Hence don’t waste your time so much on the product development. 

But selling the story based on a product. 

The cacao nibs is but a tool. 

The story IS the product

And people tell stories. 

Hence you need loads of people

[7/17/23, 10:36:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: I know. Cos I read everything u said
[10/7/23, 8:11:09 AM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 and @41799155602 

For tax reporting purposes, I am thinking for the 19% cut that our DAO earns from profit generated via the sales of Agroverse cacao nibs, these should be recognized as sales and marketing expenses on the books of TrueTech Inc and paid out to the Swiss association. 

The hands of the USA government is thus prevented from touching any of the 19%. Instead the taxation is based on Swiss law instead 

If we don’t go via this route. Those 19% will end up getting booked as profit under TrueTech Inc and charged taxes by US government 

Rather than setting up a full fledge Swiss association with by laws supporting crypto currency, I would like to propose we just setup one with a bare bone version to simply hold the funds and not deal with the cryptocurrency at this early stage.

When the profit generated via the 19% cut of the profit coming in to the Swiss association becomes substantial enough for us to have funds to throw around as we wish, we can then vote for a new set of by-laws to come into effect in the Swiss association that supports cryptocurrency. 

I feel for now just a minimal odd-number directors in the association that will not block the future set of by-laws from being voted in would be fine.

In terms of directors for the new Swiss association I am thinking:

@41796560010 
@41799155602 
@31641075825  
@16468233438

[10/7/23, 8:15:12 AM] Gary Teh: And that is how we extract our pound of flesh from all new DAO members 

Everyone who is allowed in must have sacrificed (made sacred) something before being allowed entrance 🙂🙏
[7/17/23, 10:38:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: And then develop your commission tiering system such that it highly rewards recruitment and sales
[10/7/23, 10:06:45 AM] Gary Teh: Also this will help account for all the funds we deployed from our OffChain balance for tax reduction in USA jurisdiction

The Swiss Association becomes registered as a share holder of TrueTech Inc

Then every single fiat based transaction has been accounted for in one of the taxation jurisdictions 

At the end of the day the only thing governments really care about is extracting their pound of flesh ‎<This message was edited>

[7/18/23, 6:17:22 AM] Gary Teh: Every time I get pulled into an MLM game the only thing that happens is that I end up paying for products but never successfully selling any myself 

I studied the profile of the really really strong MLM sellers, very very different profile and inclinations compared to myself. 

I believe for this to work in the USA, we need to find a @6590995199 profile in the USA.

This is tentatively what we have 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/12F8G7POEorq0Nh0iZD8eMBWVoPm9fLmkRYUgLR6033s/edit

That will grant them the rights to vote on which ESG initiative to support using the funds we set aside from the sales of our cacao nibs

Lol, I just threw away expired bag of cacao nibs. I used it to make keto bomb snacks.

Unbaked - almond flour, protein powder, coconut oil and cacao nibs. Mix into dough and form a ball. Keep it in ziplock bag refrigerated. Good for weekly sweet cravings on keto diet ‎<This message was edited>

[7/18/23, 11:34:58 AM] Gary Teh: Assuming there is a sizable enough population of community within OffChain that also follows keto, one thing might be interesting would be to sponsor sample 1 ounce bags of cacao for the events happening within the Bay area with QR code printed on them to attends.

The QR codes would direct people to our upcoming site with education on what is keto diet, and recipes on how to utilize the cacao to start their keto diet today.

Some don't even know what happens to the beans after harvest. 

@14153000019 Thanks for all the documentation.

[7/19/23, 12:16:55 PM] Gary Teh: One thing that will greatly help facilitate hooking up of new farmers into our direct to consumer network is if the local DAO member can help source for the following in the local territories

    - package printing company
    - packing company (USFDA registered)
    - shipping/freighting company 
    -  farming cooperatives (USFDA registered / US NOP registered )

We will prioritize territories that have these four components in place into our global distribution network 

we will look into other territories, once our shipping volume outgrows existing production capacity of qualified territories
[7/19/23, 3:36:42 PM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: That makes alot of sense
[7/19/23, 3:37:02 PM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: I'll look into santender and keep criolla ceremony
[10/23/23, 9:59:43 AM] Val Lapidus: I think there should be a token incentive for monetary success at venues.  I agree it is easy to get access to a venue. The difficult part is gauging the venues viability to drive future revenue and thus it should not be a matter of oh. You got us a venue.  But more so you got us a venue and this was the result. We can attribute or find ways to attribute the resulting sales bump from a venue mechanism.  Not all should be weighed equally because they are easy to get.  But more so they should be weighed on the fact that they are targeting the right audience to make purchases
[7/19/23, 3:37:39 PM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: I love the small scale but the usfda means what i realized a while ago
[10/23/23, 10:00:16 AM] Val Lapidus: Or targeting the right audience to get us followers

[10/23/23, 10:04:06 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense 🤩

A tiered system then.

125TDG is the base 

I am thinking additional TDG awards for 

    - per Instagram follower acquired 
    - per $$ sales generated ‎<This message was edited>

Please refer to the *Guilds and Projects* section of our white paper on how to propose for the formation of a new guild within our DAO 🙂👍

We could further expand on this list to include keto groups that are not based in San Francisco for our online focus group studies

Good morning, good morning.

Hope you & your family are healthy & happy (and I hope you’re reading this with your morning coffee NOT in the early morning😊).

Please allow me to confirm our call scheduled for today (Tues. Nov 2nd) at 10:30 AM CST.

Also, I sent a one-pager explaining a Strategy I’m pitching to ING.  It may be of interest (please forgive me if I’ve already shared it).

Best,

Mujahid

[11/3/23, 5:38:47 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through how to account for funds deployed from our off chain balance for our in real life experiment 

I believe it makes sense to establish a shareholding of TrueSight DAO on the TrueTech Inc ledger for fiat funds deployed from our OffChain balance even though TrueSight DAO is right now not even a legal entity yet 

Once the Agroverse revenue model is proven TrueSight DAO should be registered as an associated in Switzerland, shareholdings in TrueTech Inc for fiat funds deployed for in real life experiments will be recorded as owned by TrueSight DAO

Right now, these shares will be ear marked as own by a soon to be incorporated Swiss Association

    - clarified with Aihui on needs for FDA approved storage for our cacao nibs. Answer: not necessary. So long as it came already packaged

    - Brazilian cooperative responded with suggestions on steps to move forward based on ramp up schedule provided. Obtaining quotation from them next 

    - received proposal from Ken Lehat for USD3000. Will execute on it once we obtain quotation from Brazil and Ecuador.

    - received interim quotation from Brazil to print and pack 500 units of 8 ounce organic cacao nibs 

    - started executing on recruiting participants for our upcoming focus groups


Needs 
——
    - more help recruiting participants for our focus group - people who are or had used cacao nibs for their keto diet
[11/6/23, 12:05:20 PM] Anupa/diya: !
[8/3/23, 4:34:03 AM] Barbara Sandini: Unfortunately I don’t know anyone but I’ll ask around
[11/6/23, 12:05:56 PM] Anupa/diya: If we look at wholesale buyers process we will need for each supply
[8/3/23, 12:47:25 PM] Gary Teh: There are around more than 8 million keto forums out there. Probably too much time and effort for one person to really handle it in a scalable manner. 

I proposing to release funds of USD1000 from our vault to hire a data entry clerk on behalf of our DAO to plough through the top 1000 of these forums and post a message like this elicit the insights we are hoping to get

https://www.discusscooking.com/threads/calling-all-keto-nib-enthusiasts-share-your-cacao-wisdom-%F0%9F%8D%AB%F0%9F%92%AA.136762/

So it will be USD1 per forum.

After this deployment the asset in our vault will be down to USD2000.

[11/7/23, 12:30:31 PM] Gary Teh: In hindsight, I guess that task probably wasn’t supposed to be mind after butchering it and getting the usual *nobody experience*😱

the cooperative members went ahead and did it their own way 🤣

our incoming 100kg shipment of cacao nibs has just got some pretty awesome news coverage in Brazil! 🎈🍾👏🎊🍻🎉🥳

Please, calm down.

Better wait to have a good value proposition (after focus group) and than advertise.

[8/3/23, 12:59:58 PM] Gary Teh: It’s not for advertising 

It’s just gathering participants for our focus group or if they don’t come just trigger off the release of insights within the post themselves

Don’t need to spend USD1000 to hire a data entry clerk…

[8/3/23, 1:04:39 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. 

The gist of it is, I am open to utilizing USD from our vault to pay and have qualified research participants come for our focus groups. 🙂👍
[11/8/23, 8:35:13 AM] Gary Teh: *Proposal*
In hindsight, when me and @41799155602 conceptualized the rubric framework we have allowed *legacy propaganda* to accidentally seep into the system

The effects of this propaganda is starting to become apparent as we _scale the DAO operations_ and introduce _increasing number of different *task types*_ into our ecosystem. The result is that it becomes harder and harder for new incoming members to grasp this ever increasingly complicated mental model.

The failure @31641075825 experienced explaining this mental model to Emelin yesterday is another one of those symptoms 

I would like to propose we go back to first principles and _simplify our rubric_ to just *4 rules*

- 1 human hour = 100 TDG

- 1 USD worth of expenses paid on behalf of DAO = 1TDG

- human hour spent for task based on self reporting along with completed artifact 

- payment of expenses with USD submit receipt to channels ‎<This message was edited>

USD15 for recruiter
USD35 for participant

[8/3/23, 1:49:54 PM] Tomas - Offchain: is there any online event about cacao specialists? or keto community?
[11/8/23, 8:40:54 AM] Gary Teh: It’s not your fault. I see it as system design failure

If a system design is not idiot proof then it defaults to being a bad design 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 8:42:11 AM] Suheil - Europe: On boarding communication failure .

Every person I onboarded understood exactly how it functions :p hahahah just teasing fyi
[8/3/23, 1:54:47 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like USD1000 budget is sufficient enough to play around with to get the insights we needs 

What other thoughts and ideas are there to getting what we need from the focus groups??
[11/8/23, 8:43:43 AM] Gary Teh: Actually not just you, @16468233438 and @5511982667030 both mentioned a few times they don’t really know how the rubric system and just rely on their blind faith and trust in me to be fair 

To me this basically means system design is too complicated. Time to do a system refactor and simplify ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 10:19:05 AM] Gary Teh: That is very true.

If it is purely capitalistic, why not just do away with the whole token system and use USD? 

At which point my sense is bulk of the system will just collapse 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/23, 7:38:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Curious. What are the answers you want answered in your focus group?
[11/8/23, 10:19:42 AM] Val Lapidus: Because we don't have money to pay them.  We instead are paying them in shares which will eventually be worth something
[8/3/23, 7:44:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Some of the questions you have poses in the above discussions are very relevant.  I also really recommend googles ux course.  Module 2 knocks out the concepts and approach of ux
[11/8/23, 10:21:10 AM] Gary Teh: Why would any self respecting capitalist buy into this story over the 1001 other stories out there that could generate them more economic returns?

Come to think of it, I should probably deploy my time elsewhere 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/23, 7:45:37 PM] Tess walkowski: I got six interviews in a day at a hostel.  Sit in front of whole foods.  Find a them there!
[11/8/23, 10:21:48 AM] Val Lapidus: Well, I guess we have some non-self respecting capitalist in this group
[8/3/23, 7:46:39 PM] Tess walkowski: Too complicated.
[11/8/23, 10:22:10 AM] Val Lapidus: Because up to now people have contributed with only the promise of shares ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/23, 7:46:51 PM] Tess walkowski: Also why does it have to be in person
[11/8/23, 10:23:00 AM] Gary Teh: Not true 

A lot of them that I brought contributed based on the believe of a better world that we are building 

Not based on making a lot money 

The money component is to ensure the system self sustains
[8/3/23, 7:47:09 PM] Tess walkowski: What about LinkedIn
[11/8/23, 10:23:59 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps some folks introduced into the ecosystem were under the belief of future promised of profits 

But my sense is retention is poor from that demographic ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/23, 7:47:48 PM] Tess walkowski: I did a poll there once 100 percent of users have paid more than $5 for a chocolate treat
[11/8/23, 10:24:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Why can't it be both a better world and money in your pocket? Why is it just one or zero?
[8/3/23, 9:11:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: I agree
[11/8/23, 10:24:43 AM] Val Lapidus: Gary, you're making assumptions.  I'm in this because I want a better world.  But I also want money in my pocket and I believe the two goals are not mutually exclusive
[8/3/23, 9:11:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why don’t participants get nibs instead
[11/8/23, 10:25:05 AM] Gary Teh: It is not zero or one

It is which is the priority
[8/3/23, 9:11:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: Free product samples
[11/8/23, 10:25:50 AM] Val Lapidus: I don't think it matters which is the priority as long as both goals are relevant to the person contributing
[8/3/23, 9:12:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: So first it’s marketing
[11/8/23, 10:27:08 AM] Gary Teh: It actually does. From a system perspective when one parameter is prioritized versus another the system configuration changes 

That is why we are having this poll right now
[8/3/23, 9:12:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Second. U don’t pay money for information readily available online
[11/8/23, 10:28:25 AM] Val Lapidus: When making money is prioritized over a better world it inherently conflicts.
[8/3/23, 9:12:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: I wanna know what questions u have that is so critical that it requires a focus group
[11/8/23, 10:29:00 AM] Val Lapidus: So there is no question here that a better world is the priority. But this pole is about how contribution should be measured.

[8/3/23, 10:26:04 PM] Gary Teh: done
[11/8/23, 10:33:17 AM] Val Lapidus: If I perform a task that is cleaning up.  It should be valued less than if I perform a task that is designing a brand.  It has nothing to do with the person that more to do with the task they are doing

    - Followed up with our FSVP agent to gain more visibility on the requirements for small business exemptions before we process the USD3000 payment and link him up with our Brazilian supplier 

    - Scheduled a meeting with Brazilian Agricultural Cooperative President next Wednesday to walk through  new packaging format he surfaced which is somewhat different from the Kraft pouch. The version he surfaced looks really premium and upscale as compared to the Kraft pouch packaging format.

[11/8/23, 10:38:33 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, they are of the same value to the DAO

That said from a capitalist perspective, there is nothing preventing DAO members from hiring someone outside to cheaply perform the task in a cheaper manner (under USD100)  while themselves getting remunerated with 100TDG for getting the task completed

It acts as a forcing function for DAO members to be creative ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 11:00:24 AM] Gary Teh: One of the reasons why to have *zero or one* is because DAO eventually needs to be _smart contract based_

Constantly requiring a _subjective human judgement_ only introduces  a _bottle neck_ in the process 

So it not only hampers the transition of DAO to a _fully smart contract based_ state, it also throws in a lot of frictional against scaling the _amount of human capital_ that came be deployed per period time effectively without compromising on the *integrity* of the system

*Integrity* is one of our core values ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 11:35:10 AM] Gary Teh: In hindsight it becomes obvious why everyone is coming to me (_the accidental subjective human judge_) for judgement on how much the value of each task is  

It also reminds me of that *one principle* @5491125130580 made the last time the governors had our FaceTime hang out

_Surface one objective rule on how tokens are awarded that is self apparent and stick to it_  then the *DAO will self mobilize*. 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

Colony DAO works on tokenisation of tasks. We should look at their model
[8/7/23, 10:48:08 AM] Gary Teh: Scheduled meeting with Danielle Sunberg (founder of AMMA healing) next Tuesday

Now if we neeed Moree things, we add it up to the actual one not completely delete the based….

[11/9/23, 10:35:44 AM] Suheil - Europe: a DAO is trustless when such decisions aree being voted on from dao members not just taken autonomously from couple of members between them in privaate.
[8/8/23, 10:45:08 PM] Gary Teh: Schedule meeting with @16468233438 friend tomorrow afternoon to get more in-depth advice on how to implement go to market for physical consumer goods
[11/9/23, 10:36:09 AM] Anupa/diya: I don't think I am going to go on a public debate about this. If you wish to know about the nitty gritties about the project. It's best you set up a call with the team to make judgements which are half baked.

[11/9/23, 10:42:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: On multiple occasions you are mentioning to me that its a gap and until website will finish.

But what you are not getting is because you did this move wiithout consulting the expert that built the website dev and that is taking care of the website so you completely lost him and there is nothing that is “getting ready” to be waiting for in the first place 🤷 ‎<This message was edited>

If you were tracking the work, there was an urgent need for the onboarding process to start. This is just to full fill that i need. If you want please bring this up with the DAO, if you have any other issues.

[11/9/23, 10:51:35 AM] Suheil - Europe: i dont have any issue. I am just informing you that if you are waiting for something code development website related matter then there is a miss understanding between you and shadi … as what i understood that first version of website got ready and for him there are zero justifications to shut it down….

[11/9/23, 10:53:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I really feel you should know more about what is going on before you charge at people without knowing what is going on completely. I am sure we are all here for the benefit to a larger cause and to something that we are all proud so lets keep it at that.
[8/10/23, 12:19:48 PM] Gary Teh: Hey folks please welcome @13104674556 into our town hall. 

He is helping provide more visibility into the USA portion of our supply chain as well as the vendors we might use 🙂🙏
[11/9/23, 10:57:10 AM] Suheil - Europe: i did not charge you anything and i am sorry if you feel that way.
It is simple clear 
You tell me “ i am waiting for shadi to finish"
Shadi had no idea what was going on until i poked him asking why the website is down...

Hence, miss communication.

UNLESS you have other coder working it out with you and that its from that person that you are waiting newer webste…. as of shady he is not ,simple.

nothing personal just informing you about this gap and maybe u should clarify it out with shady ‎<This message was edited>

When someone steps on your toes you when he/she is exercising his/her personal *autonomy* but no one is hurt from it. This is a great opportunity to do some meditation. 🤩🙏

[8/11/23, 9:34:42 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. Nothing yet. 
QR code is easy to generate. 
Will try to start the site on Monday. Bulk of the copywriting could be done using ChatGpt since we got the gist of the content.

Dean literally built a portable heated shower which we used there.
Carlo built a solar powered bugee which they used to drive around the playa.

Chat with Dean when we meet on Tuesday to get a sense how he is planning to help spread the word.
[11/9/23, 11:31:03 AM] Gary Teh: For folks who haven't been locked up in a jail cell before. It can be quite a meditative experience. Or at least it was during the time I was locked up in the cell in Western China just when the Uighur uprising was happening and all the human rights controversy started happening. 🤔

[11/14/23, 6:47:28 AM] Gary Teh: Main difference 

_*Legacy system*_ - you end up deferring to me on which category your contribution belongs to 🤣

*_New system_* - you submit how many hours your effort was and that gets tokenized 100TDG per hour. 

_*Primary similarities*_
In either case each task should not be above 5000TDG. Life goes on without me 

If it is. Break it down into smaller tasks

_*Key insights*_
A DAO member working full time for DAO 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and 4 weeks a month and 12 months per year ends up making exactly the same amount in TDG a software engineer working in Silicon Valley would in USD

So the rates are quite reasonable from my perspective. I see us all as system hackers 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/15/23, 5:21:59 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposed governance token management protocol*

The purpose of this protocol is to discourage excessive speculation on our governance tokens in the open market once it gets listed on Centralized exchanges while at the same time capitalize on market fluctuations to increased our fiat netbook value per issued governance token ratio



*_Rules_*
    - _*Rule 1*_: every quarter DAO will make provisions to increase governance tokens in circulation by 25% of what is already in circulation last day of the previous quarter. 

    - _*Rule 2*_: Full amount might not end up being circulated in the market if no exceptional price ranges present themselves 

    - _*Rule 3*_: DAO will make open market purchase as and when market value at which governance token is traded at falls below USDT net book value. 

    - _*Rule 4*_: DAO will make open market sales of governance tokens up to the total provision specified for market circulation as and when market value per token exceeds the minimal of either USDT1 or USDT net book value per token



*_Conclusion_* 
This protocol for governance token management when strictly adhered to in the long haul is anti-dilutive on nature. 

It has the effect of discouraging excessive speculation activities beyond desirable price range both on the upside and the downside 

The muting of speculative components in open market pricing of DAO governance token help curtail distractions DAO governance token holders might otherwise experience away from daily practice of Satseva 


_*Prior references*_

    - Singapore’s floating exchange rate system 

     - Berkshire Hathaway share buyback policy 

    - China’s monetary policy which helped them tide through the 2008 financial crisis unscathed ‎<This message was edited>

Also perhaps a form on that page that allows people to insert their name, WhatsApp or email address and Solana wallet address they want their USDT to be transferred to once they have cashed out their governance tokens at the prevailing exchange rate

Here are the two action points that we could get @14087974677 help with next 

- when our governance tokens are listed on th exchanges 

- when we surface Agroverse shipment financing opportunities as smart contracts on chain 

When either of the two scenarios happen, @14087974677 will be very happy to share it with the VeDAO community 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/17/23, 9:14:49 AM] Gary Teh: I spent time thinking about *_WHY*_ a *_chocolate artisan_* in the Agroverse network will not want to become their own importer if and when their own operations scale up

Fundamentally it boils down to fear of *_legal repercussions*_. 

Most of these folks will be mum and pop localized operations. 

If they decide to also handle importing as part of their operations if and when FDA does an audit and surface issues with the Agroverse supply chain into USA then they will be dragged into it and their mom and pop side of the business will suffer as well. 

In that regard TrueTech Inc is the *_ultimate underwriter of legal risk*_… or more specifically *_me*_. If anything ever happens regarding the Agroverse supply chain into USA, and someone needs to go to jail, that person will be me. And it will definitely not be the first time something like this happened before (_after being mistaken for being an insurgent in Xinjiang region of China_).  🤣

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/

For a person with a more conventional domestic arrangement like someone who has a family, such an experience will be very devastating to the rest of their family members if and then one of their family members get locked up in jail. 

However in my case, everyone in the immediate family is keenly aware of this natural inclination towards *_maximized calculated risk taking*_ in my DNA hence they won’t be devasted or even surprised if and when one of these usual exceptions occur. 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/23, 9:16:05 AM] Gary Teh: The other dimension as that a *_mom and pop*_ cannot easily replicate is the decentralized nature of the DAo community which makes it exceptionally suited for sourcing in unconventional locations in the world.

[11/22/23, 9:10:22 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposal to reduce noise on WhatsApp app and increase retention rate*

I noticed that there are quite a lot of folks who have not *_clicked in to visit any of our community WhatsApp channels for more than 90 days*_

From my perspective if a community member has churned, it doesn’t make any sense to keep _spamming_ their phone with messages they are obviously no longer interested in

Also now that we are allowing people to *_submit via our community WhatsApp channels USDT cash out requests for their TDG governance tokens held*_, this seem like a great opportunity to filter out folks who have churned for various reasons while at the same time gamify retention. 

This has the side effect of also making it more likely active community members get a response when they reach out to any of the remaining community members in our channel for help as the latter folks are obviously still interested to keep updated in matters regarding our DAO and be more inclined to help than folks who have already churned. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/23/23, 5:23:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: after a quick review of all documentation , here is my analysis why we are not ready  or should not list now.

1. requires 6-8k fiat budget (after effort and discount from our lovely contact at LA token )
2. true sight eco system becomes more vulnerable to idiot hackers. (just got hacked 2 weeks ago and hackers stole only tokens that are convertible fiat , did not touch utility tokens )  hence , let’s keep the true sight token as a utility token and internal cash out /cash in control until the eco system is less vulnerable 🤷
3. listing on exchange will require heavy routine legal operations/ reporting/ declarations aka  extra costs…
[11/23/23, 5:27:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: I would lilke to request tokenize contribution of total  3 hours including: going over all documents, research and 1 zoom call with craig : listing manager at LA token

[11/23/23, 8:11:50 AM] Val Lapidus: Gary, I would like to propose an amendment to this vote.  Please add a third option which is we need to start exploring other mechanisms of communication because noise is inherent to WhatsApp.  We need channels for different topics within each guild.  Something like discord or slack
[11/23/23, 8:12:44 AM] Anupa/diya: I had suggested Slack earlier . I feel all active projects should be moved to Slack
[11/23/23, 8:14:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Personally, I have fatigue from running this on WhatsApp.  I have to scroll through hundreds of messages that have nothing to do with me to find the message that I'm looking for. Have to keep the mental load of if I want to find a previous message that was important. I have to remember who sent it or remember specific contextual clues for it from it in order to search for it. It's exhausting,

[11/23/23, 8:29:16 AM] Val Lapidus: This needs to be a decision completely agreed on by the governors
[11/23/23, 10:03:23 AM] Gary Teh: It is your *Autonomy* 🙂🙏

_PS: what I observe is the herd behavior tends to follow DAO members exercising personal *Autonomy* in executing critical functions in our DAO._

_After analyzing all the different functions, the most *critical ones* are_ 

    - _ledger update_ 
    - _fiat funding_
    - _supply chain management_

_If there is only one DAO member exercising *Autonomy* in any of these, then the DAO becomes centralized around that specific function_ ‎<This message was edited>

[11/24/23, 2:42:43 PM] Gary Teh: Johnson did surface *_Sushiswap*_ as a possible option last year as a DEX last year 

Did a 10 minute research at the codebase level, *_Uniswap*_ might be more suitable for Ethereum ERC20 token types once we migrated our TDG governance tokens over from Solana to Ethereum 

*_Uniswap*_ allows for Automated market making and also liquidity pool staking using _USDT/ETH/BTC_.

Actually if you are really keen on Slack you should just go ahead and revive this slack channel 🙂🙏
https://join.slack.com/t/truesight-group/shared_invite/zt-27r7rowr6-NBR58UmtHKNen2jBZRKq~A

Neil (DAO member and former engineering manager at Edmodo) set it up when he and his brother started working on some engineering related tasked. 

Richard was active on it as well when he was helping build out the frontend UI of Edgar. 

Gautam (_Technical staff contextual Ai_) was also hanging out in that channel when we were discussing how USA college students understood Metaverse as well as exploring various implementations of Zero Knowledge proofs on blockchain for the prediction market project from last year

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_LAioUeYvbSuuCuiPCd87t4VLx_PkqXBn3ggIn8Fxs/edit#heading=h.efqfwk7iwt0y 

From my perspective it might actually be easier to poll slack for messages to automate contribution tokenization than it is for WhatsApp. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/26/23, 7:26:01 PM] Gary Teh: *key constrains to consider*

    - slack charges after a certain number of people joins

   - slack does not allow access to historical messages older than 3 months without paying 

*_proposal for you if you are keen_*

Go ahead and start it as a side experiment with folks you work closely with. 

If it gains traction great. 

If not, it was a cheap experiment

[11/29/23, 4:12:39 PM] Gary Teh: The rules will have been published in the @120363044914723610@g.us channel

[11/29/23, 4:13:27 PM] Gary Teh: That is true. 

Nothing preventing them from joining the @120363041505997891@g.us again since they are governance token holders
[11/29/23, 4:13:55 PM] Iwona Fluda: It is great that it has been published. I think we had this discussion once: How many of us read the Terms & Conditions of every community we are joining? I guess: none.
[11/29/23, 4:14:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Sending everyone an email or a message with this information before enforcing this decision will help people to rethink their involvement.
[11/29/23, 4:16:54 PM] Iwona Fluda: I'm not sure if that would be helpful. Once trust is broken, then is broken; not sure how many people would even consider coming back. 

Just speaking from experience as I have run private communities over the last few years, and everything there is based on trust and mutual understanding.
[11/29/23, 4:30:05 PM] Gary Teh: There is also the other perspective too

For folks who hasn’t been in these channels for a long time, sending them a direct message regarding something that they no longer care about will just come across as spam in their inbox
[11/29/23, 4:33:59 PM] Iwona Fluda: We don't know if they don't care about it. Depending on the message it can be also taken as a great reminder to them that it exists.

Those that we don’t, we have some of their LinkedIn, Instagram or WhatsApp on the tab ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:47:03 PM] Gary Teh: In all 7 WhatsApp channels 

The reason why this clean up is because I know alot of folks use WhatsApp for communicating with their families and very close friends, so having undesired messages on their WhatsApp feels way more intrusive than on their LinkedIn, email, Instagram…

Hence the reason why I really want to minimize this intrusion into their private space ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:48:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: On this list, just a small group of people has their phone number or email address...

I know a lot of them don’t even bother to respond to my private 1 on 1 message until months later (_on the average six months_)🤣

https://edgar.truesight.me/roadmap

Based on how I observed the way things played out in our ecosystem, seems the roadmap is already outdated 

And it is in a good way. EU expansion started ahead of schedule as @41799155602 decided to exercise his autonomy.

First meeting with European distributor happens coming Monday. @41799155602 is leading it, supported by @31641075825 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

I am *_going to stop fund ongoing DAO expenses with my personal liquidity*_ starting beginning of this month. 

the USA government has a shutdown scenario that is often reported in the news
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdowns_in_the_United_States

when our *_DAO runs out of liquidity*_, the following will happen 

    - TrueSight.me wix account shutdown 

    - Agroverse.shop Wix account shutdown 

    - Stamps.com account shutdown

    - Amazon.com seller account shutdown 

    - TrueTech Inc our legal wrapper in USA shutdown

[12/4/23, 12:34:49 PM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan for Agroverse sales related activities*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions to commercial buyer 

    - utilize existing 4 rules rubric based system without introducing additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the initial sale from buyer

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO, DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call for coordination_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator but not the role of sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a buyer. All prior listed rules (1-4) applies
[12/4/23, 12:36:09 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Have this set of rules come into effect?
‎OPTION: Yes! It offers proper incentive for sales related activities while keeping tokenomics balanced (2 votes)
‎OPTION: No! Why so much new rules!?! (0 votes)
[12/4/23, 4:49:40 PM] Val Lapidus: Is this closing door on any fiat compensation or is that still available to sellers
[12/4/23, 6:31:13 PM] Gary Teh: Totally closed
[12/5/23, 4:44:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I think it's better to involve the first round of decision making with people who are actively working in the project and then it can come the DAO
[12/5/23, 7:08:35 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with @918017107841 hence why I have proposed a debate in the agroverse guild to flush out the best suitable incentives model for scaling a FMCG. This current proposal doesn’t reflect the complete value chain.
[12/5/23, 7:09:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I vote for n.3: current proposal not suitable for agroverse business model.
[12/5/23, 8:29:53 AM] Gary Teh: Since this does impact the distribution of governance tokens and hence voting rights within our DAO. 

The town hall is a more appropriate place for this debate to take place 

@120363044028036610@g.us is discussions for day to day operational matters only 

*_Analogy*_
    - @120363044028036610@g.us is the factory floor where workers build stuff

    - Townhall is where all the board of directors (general assembly) sit to discuss about policy matters impacting the entire DAO 

_PS: you don’t cook dinner in the toilet_
[12/5/23, 8:47:19 AM] Vlatko Gigov: No problem, we can discuss anywhere: 

What is the commission charged for processing payments on the agroverse shop? 

What is the commission charged by Amazon for selling products on their platform? 

Why should there be a discrimination against a human sales force if other mediums are adequately compensated? 

What is the incentive of the 46 other town hall members to actually act as a board of directors instead of just the empty floscule about board of directors exercising governance rights based on their tokens. 

How will you incentivise a decentralized sales force other than with $ sales commissions? If the sales rep wishes to relinquish the $ commission and obtain gov tokens that should be at their discretion.
[12/5/23, 8:47:54 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Otherwise this whole exercise becomes like the good ol’ communist order: we are all equal but some are more equal than the others. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 8:49:44 AM] Anupa/diya: The reason for proposing is that the internal team will be much for equipped to take decisions for matters that they work on rather in a whatsapp group where people will have to invest time reading, doing some sort of research if they lack information and then make decision. Which I clearly don't see happening
[12/5/23, 8:56:08 AM] Vlatko Gigov: FMCG scaling is much more different than selling software products. Also the relatives of our organisation do not allow for a salaried sales force. Even if the ales force was on a salary base there would still be % remuneration for successful sales. In the current case, the remuneration proposed only cators to a select few BOD members.
[12/5/23, 8:56:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: “We are all equal but some are more equal than the others”
[12/5/23, 9:01:04 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess the questions that we need to answer are:

1. How do we incentivise a decentralised sales force (Herbalife model maybe IDK)

2. How do we make sure everyone’s efforts are adequately and appropriately compensated? 

3. Your proposed model only allows for one thing to happen: a huge DUMP or even worse a rug pull from the largest token holders or the treasurer, if you remember our exciting trip in Dubai and the experts… 🤣
I hope your toilet analogy is not n.3 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:03:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @everyone these are very exciting times of this DAO, being there nearly from the beginning it’s a great experience. Many have told us that things will disintegrate much sooner. That we will never get this far because: there is not huge capital from a coin offering to incentivise contributions against or there isn’t a liquid token to exchange for.
[12/5/23, 9:04:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I’m open to other suggestions as long as we move slightly away from far left economic models. 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:07:28 AM] Vlatko Gigov: But liquidity will happen if we develop a sound economic model and incentives structures. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:49:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: By the way I am arguing here against my case since I hold second or third largest tdg purse, which is pointless if I don’t have an army of motivated and incentivised sales force to scale organic agroverse products… ie bringing dollarz to the treasury ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:50:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The other route would be let’s do an ICO and hope not to get flagged by the SEC if our bizz models fail and we deplete the treasury…
[12/5/23, 9:51:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I would always choose structured organic growth before a crowdfunding operation.
[12/5/23, 9:51:57 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Then once we have stable revenue models we can do a coin offering.
[12/5/23, 9:53:44 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess you are right @14153000019 to discuss these matters here: 1. Governance, 2. Treasury Management, 3. Sales force incentives
[12/5/23, 12:05:25 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to start incentivizing people with Fiat.  issuing tokens for me personally is fine.  but I think we can get a higher quality of sales people by giving them a monitary incentive to sell the product. And don’t get all flustered that most people are not here to be capitalists.  We are selling to capitalists, we should probably employ a few that understand the motivations.
[12/5/23, 12:07:17 PM] Val Lapidus: And as I’ve stated previously the monitory incentive to sell can be collected by any one, regardless of where they live, there is no barrier to entry to do this job, and there is nothing to prevent you from doing it.
[12/5/23, 12:28:23 PM] Gary Teh: We should test this hypothesis 

*Proposed test*

Recruit 10 test subjects to do sales 

5 subjects granted fiat only incentive 

5 subjects granted TDG only incentive 

All 10 subjects granted the same script to use to sell

Each subject required to generate their own sales leads 

Measure sales performance (average sales generated per subject) of these 2 groups over a 90 day period 

Group with the higher average sales revenue generated is *winning variant*

Roll out variant into production environment

_PS: someone else will need to run this experiment. I am exercising my *autonomy* not to do it as it is boring for me and I will be utilizing my time to do something else 🙂🙏_
[12/5/23, 12:44:21 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what needs to be proved out here. Gary.  And I'm going to practice my autonomy by not doing this and urge my fellow governor's not to do this as well. Human kind has been incentivized by money for hundreds of years. What? What am I proving?  So far our sales have been zero.  People have always had the autonomy to go and sell the product.  But have not utilized it.
[12/5/23, 12:45:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The logical option would be for sales agents to exercise autonomy: whether they want to receive $ or tokens or a mix of the two.
[12/5/23, 12:46:54 PM] Gary Teh: They don’t have the tools to sell

No tools no sales
[12/5/23, 12:47:36 PM] Vlatko Gigov: https://mapmycustomers.me/2021/10/13/average-sales-rep-compensation-by-industry/
[12/5/23, 12:47:44 PM] Val Lapidus: Has anyone actually volunteered and asked for the tools to sell?
[12/5/23, 12:48:21 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Well the simple deck / product information sheet hasn’t been prepared. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 12:51:39 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Yes the sales deck should just one page in the pres deck.
[12/5/23, 12:52:19 PM] Val Lapidus: If they are highly motivated, they can build whatever materials they want to sell the product
[12/5/23, 12:52:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The story existed, and it’s a good one. Now that we have the momentum we shouldn’t give up..
[12/5/23, 12:52:39 PM] Val Lapidus: They have a forum within agroverse to ask questions
[12/5/23, 12:53:10 PM] Val Lapidus: This is an autonomous out organization and should function as one.
[12/5/23, 12:53:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: When @918017107841 was in the agroverse guild things were running a tad bit smoother. Al thought that is not her scope.
[12/5/23, 12:55:24 PM] Val Lapidus: There is no one and nothing stopping the people wanting to sell from selling.  If they need materials to sell, they need to build the materials, not wait for me, or Gary, or any one else to be the bottleneck.  Autonomy is defined as: the right or condition of self-government.
[12/5/23, 12:58:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Makes sense to me. As I am illiterate in design work, I do exercise my autonomy to seek for help
[12/5/23, 12:58:35 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:09:30 PM] Gary Teh: Most of them don’t even know how the product actually looks and feel like 

It is very hard to pitch a physical product to a buyer without having one in your hand

The first thing I notice anyone does when they pick up the product is to put it to their nose and breathe in ecstasy 

Kind of hard to replicate that buying experience without the actual product in hand 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:10:15 PM] Val Lapidus: If they need the product, they should ask
[12/5/23, 1:10:40 PM] Val Lapidus: The only one who’se asked is Rodney and Vigi
[12/5/23, 1:10:56 PM] Gary Teh: And they did 

@41799155602 and @19209806391 

I know @18175503434 was asking about it when we chatted
[12/5/23, 3:12:52 PM] Vlatko Gigov: For me the deck / product spec is more important. Retailers know what nibs are they don’t know why our nibs differentiate from the non-organic competitors. Agroverse story is strong. Most of that info is in the website… ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 9:21:00 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 strike from @41799155602

You kept him hanging and waiting for you after promising you will deliver him the deck but did not update him when plans changed

Please apologize to him privately 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:22:58 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 strike one for you 

You requested for @5511982667030 to reserve time to attend the talk you were going to organize but did not inform her of change of plans 

She had the whole reserved for you when she could have utilized it to do something else 

Please apologize to her privately 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:31:52 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's we take Autonomy has an example. Everyone has their own idea of what autonomy looks like  

In a project, if there are set actions given then those must be followed. if someone is doing something and someone else comes in and says it's my autonomy to change things. That's not on and it's a waste of time. 

Autonomy has to be defined for each project according to me because the variables differ from case to case.
[12/5/23, 9:35:05 PM] Anupa/diya: The people working within the project can decide what autonomy looks like for them and for larger issues it can be referenced to the DAO.
[12/5/23, 9:39:01 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That is why the contributions rubric was the closest thing to autonomy imo. I understand it’s a nightmare to keep track of the variables, but it only makes sense to appropriate quality metrics instead of quantity (# of hours)
[12/5/23, 9:43:42 PM] Anupa/diya: There can be sections - work remuneration past and present / work ethics/ deliverables/ code of conduct/ and so forth . This will also come under the governance. The main structure can be sub divided to small groups.
[12/5/23, 10:03:57 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 and @918017107841 

Please feel free to exercise your autonomy to work together to define and then propose a new rubric for voting into effect. 

I am open to exercising my autonomy to stand aside and refrain from further contribution to DAO until the new rubric has been proposed and voted on 🙂🙏

_PS: from my perspective this is part of DAO’s process of maturing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 10:11:41 PM] Anupa/diya: I don't think this should be the case. Let it run as it is for now till a group of active members can collectively draw up something defined

Two people from the DAO  might not reflect the voice of what the DAO wants. The governors table along with any other members can sort this out

There are a lot of things that need to be discussed.Rubric is one of them.
[12/5/23, 10:12:15 PM] Anupa/diya: Rubric has to taken in a lot of aspects and it has to be a collective decision so I wait for that group to be formed.
[12/6/23, 3:12:58 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe there should be a definition for the workflow and values for each specific project and people inside agree to that if not, they leave.

[12/6/23, 4:57:53 AM] Tomas - Offchain: the questions about engagement, ghosting, rules, behaviors, incentives, and payments are still in the air, Maybe ghosting here was an answer to a specific situation or a wrongly defined problem. Maybe it would be valuable to understand what happened to understand which rules work better. I would ask why did it happen to understand the root cause a little more. I agree that waiting for something that undermines our autonomy goes against the core principles.

[12/6/23, 7:59:44 AM] Tomas - Offchain: I think the whole purpose of Blockchain is that there is no need to remember or forgetting. Not even forgetting
[12/6/23, 8:05:04 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense, that is because your entire kharma within the ecosystem is recorded on the chain

Reddit for example does not allow members with exceptionally low kharma to contribute in certain things 

From my perspective, if a member’s kharma point is too low, I will be hesitant in allowing member to undertake task on critical path in projects even if member volunteers to do so

If you haven’t noticed already, new incoming members reaching out to me offering to help are often first assigned to task that are not on the critical path. 

The purpose of this is do an integrity verification

[12/6/23, 5:54:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel we need to update the governance model. A lot of it comes under for ethics and code of conduct. Deciding on actions over a poll on whatspp is slightly hasty 🤣 I feel there has to be a state and agreed document by the group where all or these are stayed and with outcomes decided for the most and then the voting should come into play.i don't think we can so lightly state strike outs. 

One might not even agree to the strike outs since it was not even stated by them so where is the autonomy in that. I don't think anyone is at the position to state a strike out even for themselves because it has to be community led and not dependent on one person and their decision.

One should be allowed to propose a strike out or any other rule, the town hall decide and then decide. 

When there is governors all categories should be voted or discussed for future voting

[12/6/23, 10:26:19 PM] Anupa/diya: The second conversation which I think that needs to start is the participation of the community. Since the participation is low with the given numbers. We should try and look at what the community wants. Everyone in the beer hall has so much to offer and the key question is how can they find value in the community and vice versa. 

Not everyone will be invested in the currents projects. So how do we mobilize the community. Cypher defense days  were great with so much activity

- ⁠What is the gist story you are trying to tell? 
- ⁠What are the components in your story?

He is not a sales person

Right now they are myself, you, @19209806391 and @12245781775

_*Location of code base*_
- https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/contribution_scoring/blob/main/Sandbox.ipynb



_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQg09aFTlyUNez3w1GHX4GCQ6b1P3jaUz52z29TUHcw/edit#gid=2120247626



_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels

let me know when you have withdrawn the brazilian Rei from our USA bank account to cover R$299 you have fronted using your own money 

DAO is right now owing you money and you are incurring loses from you funds not being able to deployed back to your personal investment account 

Thank you for helping facilitate that 🙂🙏
[12/15/23, 10:19:13 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030

I think the right thing to do in this case would be to compensate you for the interest losses using our treasury balance for facilitating this transaction even though you could have just ignore our request for help. 

I am aware amongst all the DAO members here there are those that are not short on cash to finance their personal day to day expenses and you definitely not one of them. 

When you make the withdrawal in Brazilian R$ please also withdraw the amount for interest you would have otherwise made had the loan amount you provided to the DAO stayed deployed in your own investment account. 

If anyone else in the TownHall please state your case now otherwise  we will just leave it as that 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
