*_Manufacturers*_ that utilize our raw material for their own final product, really only care about availability of supplies and price. if we go down this route, we will just end up haggling over price and margins with the buyer and the farmers. It will only further compound the inertia in the industry that is right now causing all these social and environmental problems, the source of all this negative PR in the industry right now.


When that the price of the end product matches with existing brands out there, *_USA Consumers*_ are very sensitive to the narrative/brand story. And will be very inclined to switch. All thanks to the 2020 pandemic and the increasing concerns about climate change... every new report of nature disasters that are attributed to climate change only serves to galvanize more support for the @120363044028036610@g.us brand story

- The key takeaways are the total production volume of Organic cacao is 1200 tons a year

- ⁠ only 10% of these supplies are properly fermented with at least 80% fermentation level

- ⁠ the fermentation of the other 90% of the supplies is inconsistent  hence lots of them are just sold bulk price 

- ⁠ he proposed to set up a separate fermentation facility to handle fermentation to increase the total supply of well to be above 10% of the organic cacao supply by 3X

- ⁠ makes total sense why the markup for organic cacao versus bulk price in this region is around 20% as opposed to 100%

- ⁠ totally explains why Natalia emphasized this during our conversation two weeks ago

- ⁠ also explains why the directors of the corporative yesterday was asking how many percent fermentation in the cacao we are seeking in our sourcing

- ⁠ finally explains the anomaly in the Organico pricing that I observed when @554792591729 first surfaced the pricing from this region to me earlier this year

Gary Teh,,"*Reflections for the Sunday*

- The final three hours yesterday evening was the most critical qualitative observation during this entire week since arriving in Altamira.

- Jedie pulled over on the highway while on our way back to Altamira when he saw a fellow organizer of the event had a flat tire. It was in the middle of nowhere where there was zero cell phone reception.

- He first tried to help change the tire using his own tools but quickly realize the nuts were a different size.

- He drove for 20 minutes to the nearby farm attempting to get help but realized the farm was closed.

- He drove for 30 minutes to a nearby restaurant attempting to get help.

- He managed to finally arrange for help to come.

- He drove back to the organizer’s truck to explain the help he has setup

- He brought loaded passenger on the other truck over to our truck to bring the passenger back to Altamira while help came

*Constrains he experienced during the entire situation*

- It’s been a long day, we were all physically tired especially since he went to bed pretty late the night before as well

- ⁠the sun has set. Road conditions were bad and it was pouring heavily

- ⁠The gear box of our truck was already on the verge of failing. He was praying for the gear box to continue holding before our drive back to Altamira

*Personal interpretation*

- If Jedie had a weaker character he could have just ignored the fellow participant who was experiencing trouble and continued going about his business.

- I always believe you can’t change a person’s character, but instead you could do is to be very diligent when selecting professional partners based on desirable character trait that they already exhibit when undertaking minor things.

- ⁠My interpretation from this, when issued a request, Jedie will to the utmost of his abilities deliver on the requirements. <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 365.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 365.00,20240630

Gary Teh,,"Spent 2 hours thinking through the qualitative data collected from the folks in the Bahia and Para community

the prevailing norm is for dominant chocolate manufacturers (_majority European based_) to import cacao from these communities, perform the manufacturing in Europe before redistributing the end products to the consumers, in the process capturing the bulk of the profit margin for themselves.

Analysis with the help of Meta AI shows that USA is in fact the world’s largest market for chocolate consumption. 

Shifting manufacturing away from Europe to the source countries and then importing the manufactured end product directly into USA if done properly will yield structural cost savings that will be hard for European manufacturers to compete against in the USA market (_we don’t incur logistic cost associated with having a European leg in our supply chain_). 

From my limited understanding, since there is a lot of labor union protection in these European, shifting their manufacturing to source countries for these companies is like pulling teeth. It will also generate very very bad PR for them domestically. But since we have zero legacy, we dont have this problem.

From this perspective, the *disruptive innovation/ differentiation is the structure of the supply chain itself*

- Importing directly into the USA, _the world's largest market_, from source countries
- Direct sourcing from small scale farming to support regenerative farming practices in the Amazon rainforest
- ⁠Stimulating local industry growth to eventually displace the dominant chocolate manufacturers
- Reducing carbon footprint by eliminating the European leg of the supply chain
- offer USA consumers high quality cacao as opposed to low quality cacao at the same prevailing price

The *final outcome*
- Environment: reduced carbon footprint and support for regenerative farming
- Consumers: high-quality cacao at a competitive price
- Local communities: economic growth and empowerment <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 200.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 200.00,20240702

Gary Teh,,"Bumped into Eddy Diamantis, a FullBright scholar, undergoing internship for a U.S. law firm. He is undertaking an assignment for their firm on behalf of some USA govnerment. The goal is to figure out how to further increase USA foreign direct investment as well as near shoring in this region 

*_My interpretation*_

- USA barely has any foreign investment interest in Brazil 

- ⁠BRICS was signed last year and during which time Brazilian President has stated USA relationship is not of much significance compared to China trade relations

- ⁠China’s belt road initiative is really helped China gained lots of influence in this region

Gary Teh,,"*Reflections on this ultra high purchase price set by the exchange*

Though the sale and purchase prices are different, it has achieved the same desired effect. 

Contributors who _mine_ the TDG governance tokens with their physical time and effort to build our projects or pay for project expenses using USD fiat are gifted TDG as tokens of appreciation for their contributions

While speculators on the CEX exchanges who just want to buy into the tokens, end up paying elevated purchase prices. 

_Added bonus:_
Contributors/Miners who wants to cash out some of their tokens to cover personal daily expenses can do so at the original TDG exchange rate without being penalized for cashing out early by having to sell at Cash in vault per issued token valuation

I assume the exchange is probably the one making the surplus from the sale of TDG at the ultra elevated prices 

Overall Win-Win-Win-Win 🙂🙏

Makes more sense to tap directly into centigrade.earth for the carbon credit issue if they already have a streamlined process in place

If centigrade.earth already have buyers as well then I don’t see where nature wired would be impactful

Karen’s main value add will likely be marketing the issued carbon credit to potential buyers in the USA market if centigrade.earth does not already have a pipe line of carbon Credit buyers

But If she can’t find buyers for the carbon credit, I don’t really see where the actual value add is by complicating the technology stack allowing nature wired MVP into it 🤔 <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 100.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 100.00,20240713

Gary Teh,,"Spent an hour facetime with Karen Hardy

*Key Takeaways on what was discussed*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface...
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Agroverse is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit. <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 1.65,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 1.65,20240717

Gary Teh,,"_PS: Secondary pattern observed. When I studied DataBricks (a data lake provider based in Silicon Valley ) growth model, I observed their growth strategy for enterprise account heavily relied on timing their outreach to enterprise customers at around the time when contracts their clients have with their data infrastructure suppliers were about to expire and are becoming open to new ones._

_Climate change disruption on supply chains can be figuratively seen as Nature forcing all the enterprise buyers to rethink their current contracts with their suppliers as their suppliers were forced to drastically change price on them. This causes existing buyers to become open to new suppliers_

_Shena when she text to me 2 weeks ago mentioned that coffee farmers Costa Rica are right now facing supply disruption as well thanks to climate change._

_When there is disruption there is a market gap and when there is a market gap there is an opportunity to exploit the gap_

_It also extends beyond the agriculture industry into the real estate industry.

Gary Teh,,"Seems like we’ve somehow opened the Pandora box with the listing of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchange

Prior to this, no one from the centralized exchanges seem to care or were interested to talk to us (_not that we tried very hard_)

Suddenly, we have a huge influx of centralized cryptocurrency exchange listing managers queueing up wanting us to list our governance tokens on their centralized exchanges

My sense is the fact the trading value of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchanges is holding up has provided a strong signal that the underlying token economics of our DAO  is financially sound hence why it caught their interest

_PS: my sense is we should maintain the relationship and hold them at bay while we focus on our core operations which is to drive the sales volume of shipments into USA_

_once we have hit the 50% sales completion mark of the next shipment, negotiate for the best deal from amongst these other CEX and then list on just one. This will help maintain if not boost the sense of exclusivity that comes with the opportunity to list our governance tokens_

_this is much like the strategy that Gmail used to roll out to release of its service to its early users as well as the way Waymo is rolling is right now rolling out self driving taxi to early users in San Francisco_ <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 1.65,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 1.65,20240722

- Estimate cost of goods before freighting and customs clearance cost to be financed: $10,876.19
- ⁠Total expected returns on shipment: $12,183.81 (_112.02%_)
- ⁠Total amount to be made by DAO after shipment sales completion in USA market: $10,514.64
- ⁠Total returns to financiers: $1,669.17 (_15.35% return on capital injected_)

Gary Teh,,"Now that _*OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)_* have became more widely adopted in our DAO and we have worked with it for a few iterations, I figure it is a good time for me to share my thoughts on it

From my perspective, *_Objectives_* has to do with processes and concrete tasks within the processes that DAO member undertakes. It is deterministic. By just looking at the logs, we can determine if a DAO member consistently been executing on process or not.

*_Key results_* are the outcomes. Until time set is due, we do not know for sure if the outcomes will be within our desired target range. They are probabilistic. Only a very small fraction of the inputs are within the control of DAO member undertaking the process driving these outcomes. The form of control DAO member has is the way tasks are conducted within the processes. 

The best thing we can do to improve outcome is to share with the DAO what we have learned that work and what did not as we iterate through the different variants of our processes.

Over the past quarter, I have been undertaking a very systematic process of identifying various DAO members whom I then later communicated clearly, I will not engaging in any future form of transactions within the realms of commerce, investments and money. This is primarily because enough data has been gathered to show that when given the opportunity to execute on a self-defined and agreed upon process, instead of a deterministic outcome, it ends up being a probabilistic one.

A rule I learned from our fellow DAO member Ilya who manages a hedge fund in Wall Street which seems very applicable to our domain. A fund manager cannot be faulted on _*the OUTCOME_* of a trading strategy but must definitely be faulted when he fails to diligently follow the defined trading strategy (_the PROCESS_).",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 1.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 1.00,20240822

Emelin - Bahia,,"To ensure that a cacao tree is part of a totally organic production system, several key practices and principles need to be followed. Here’s a comprehensive look at what makes cacao production organic:

1. No Synthetic Chemicals
Pesticides and Herbicides: Organic cacao production avoids synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Instead, it uses natural pest control methods and organic-approved substances.
Fertilizers: Chemical fertilizers are replaced with organic fertilizers like compost, manure, and green manure.
2. Soil Health and Management
Organic Matter: Organic farming emphasizes the use of organic matter to maintain soil fertility. This includes composting, mulching, and green manuring.
Soil Conservation: Techniques such as cover cropping and reduced tillage are used to maintain soil health and prevent erosion.
3. Pest and Disease Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Organic cacao farms use IPM strategies, which include biological control agents (like beneficial insects), companion planting, and manual removal of pests.
Disease Prevention: Practices such as proper spacing, pruning, and the use of resistant cacao varieties help prevent disease.
4. Sustainable Farming Practices
Water Management: Efficient water use and conservation practices are crucial to prevent waterlogging and maintain soil structure.
Biodiversity: Organic cacao farms often incorporate agroforestry practices, maintaining a diverse ecosystem to support natural predators and improve soil health.
5. Certification
Organic Certification: To be recognized as organic, cacao farms must obtain certification from an accredited organic certifying body. This involves adhering to specific standards and undergoing regular inspections.
6. Non-GMO Seeds
Seed Sourcing: Organic cacao production requires using non-GMO seeds and plants. Cacao varieties should be chosen based on their organic compatibility.
7. Sustainable Practices
Energy Use: Organic farms strive to use renewable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint.
Waste Management: Organic cacao producers manage waste through composting and recycling to minimize environmental impact.
8. Ethical Labor Practices
Fair Trade: Many organic cacao farms also follow fair trade principles, ensuring fair wages and ethical treatment of workers.
9. No Synthetic Additives in Processing
Processing: When processing cacao, organic certification ensures that no synthetic additives, artificial flavors, or colors are used.",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 3.33,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 3.33,20240903

Confirmation with the Certifier: The seal usually includes the name of the certifying body. You can verify the validity of the seal by contacting the certifying body directly or visiting their official website to confirm if the farm is listed as certified.
2. Seal Consistency
Authenticity of the Seal: Make sure the seal looks authentic and is from a recognized certification organization. A counterfeit seal or one from an unknown organization may be a red flag.
3. International Recognition
Recognized Certifying Bodies: Check if the seal belongs to a certification body recognized internationally, such as USDA Organic (USA), EU Organic (European Union), or other certifications recognized in your country.
4. Farm Documentation
Request Documentation: If possible, ask the farm or supplier for more information about the certification, including documents and records proving compliance with organic standards.
5. Transparency and Traceability
Additional Information: Organic products often come with information about their origin and the certification process. Transparency in how the product was grown and processed is a good sign of authenticity.
6. References and Reviews
Research the Farm: If possible, research the reputation of the farm or supplier. Feedback from other consumers and reliable references can help ensure authenticity.
7. Consider Brand Trustworthiness
Reputable Brands: Buying from reputable brands and distributors with experience in organic products can increase confidence that the seal is legitimate.",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 18.33,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 18.33,20240903

Emelin - Bahia,,"I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240912
