Gary Teh,,"_*Murmurs from the USA cacao market_*

After rounds of feedback gathering that @16468233438 has conducted with the USA chocolatiers, and me with the USA consumers.

The taste of Gourmet cacao is more refined due to the additional care in the processing and thus pricier. 

USA chocolatiers are accustomed to working with the usual bulk cacao supplies and their corresponding price points.

The USA chocolate connoisseur knows quality when she taste it and is willing to pay premium price for it. 

*_Proposed path forward_*
Our mission is to heal the world with love and restore its beauty. In the case of our cacao nibs, restoring our rainforest. So long as we have the opportunity to help further increases the sales and distribution of  agricultural produce grown regeneratively by the farmers, we should go for it.


- Have two product lines targets at the different target segments

- ⁠*Gourmet cacao market segment* - targeted at the direct to premium consumer market segment - cacao ceremonies, medicinal ingredients infused cacao 

- ⁠*Bulk cacao* - targeted at chocolatiers who want to enhance their brand story by supporting our climate change efforts, but don’t want to incur the premium that comes along with the gourmet cacao process.

_PS: This seems to be the norm for other brands I had the opportunity to encounter_ ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,,"*insight from this morning’s 1 hour meditation*

After much curation within my personal network, looking back at 20 years of personal data as well as reading through the biographies of the top organization builders, the most important function within any organization with a commercial intent is *_Marketing (making money 💰💸💵💶💷💴🤑)*_

*_Sources*_
- Ryu - business developer
- ⁠Jerry Luk - President of Fireworks
- ⁠Peter Gwee - DAO member, 3 generation business man in the fenshui industry 
- ⁠Dad - third generation business man in the food distribution industry
- ⁠Vinod Nair - CEO money smart 
- ⁠Richard Brandon 
- ⁠Elon Musk
- ⁠@6598383264 

PS: when the *_marketing (making money)*_ function works wells, the rest of the function will automatically work well of their own accord 

Creators are drawn to a space because they enjoy the process of building a product. 

Paradoxically, to really be successful in a space, creators have to step away from the product development function and focus on the organization building itself and most especially through marketing function.

Creators that have been observed to struggle are those who cling on for too long to the product building instead of letting otters handle it. 

When the marketing function works well and starts bringing in 💴💷💶💵💸🤑, specialists from various functions will naturally get attracted into the organization to support in the other functions ‎<This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 100.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 100.00,20240322

DAO has eyes and ears over the place, spread across six continents to be exact. It’s a really wide net which ends up picking up a lot of opportunities. More opportunities than DAO has resources to pursue

At this point, it makes sense to follow the GE rule

Unless DAO has an unfair advantage that other players in the market niche don’t, and DAO can see a path to end up either the leader or close second in the market niche associated with a market opportunity, we will not deploy our resources to pursue the opportunity

Even thought weed is officially legalized, weed from the legal channels are of poorer quality and more expensive. Legal distributors need to pay government their taxes and end up needing to cut back on quality 

Meanwhile weed off the black market is of way higher quality but at 50% the price since no taxes were paid to the government and more money could be deployed to generate higher quality output

Great place to promote our cacao 

People loved it for the following reasons 

- the taste from the way the medicine of the heart was prepared was spectacular 

- ⁠the story of being able to perform a simple act to help restore our rainforest was absolutely empowering to these folks most of whom have never stepped outside of the country before 

- ⁠the price point was a no brainer

The local honey mead (_wine_) producer came up and requested for my contact details

He is seeking chocolate to lace his honey mead with 

There doesn’t seem to be any local chocolatier

The closest chocolatier he can visit is in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon 

As a source he feels it’s very important to be able to taste test it before placing an order of shipment

Gary Teh,,"As adviced by Peter Thiel (_paypal cofounder_), gain a large share of a small market and then scaling strategically.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7ewO1IyZun/?igsh=MXNjdWNqM2sxaHM4ag== 

Competition has been non-existent and if they did exist, our offering is sufficiently differentiated at these small scale regional barter faires up here in the Pacific Northwest. 

From my perspective, it is strategic to fully saturate this distribution and establish a firm foothold before we start expanding to the next distribution channels.

Part of this process will be identifying and recruiting the lieutenants to secure and continue operating these areas before I shift my attention to the next adjacent distribution channel

This is where having an Multilevel marketing model in place comes in handy ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,,"There seems to be a tribune of elders amongst the nomad community that regularly communicate amongst themselves where they collectively maintain a black list of people that should be kept out of the network. 

The reverse seem to be also the case where elders in the community will take notice of an outsider when an elder vouches for him or her. These unnamed elders will at their own time and pace come interact with the outsider and come to their own judgement.

As more and more elders in the network vouch for this outsider, he/she gains status/reputation within the network. The by-product is invitation to access network facilities that are not usually accessible to outsiders.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240528

Gary Teh,,"Seems the best way to rapidly gain reputation and support within the nomadic network in the Pacific Northwest is to bring a ton of food to each campfire I visit and then cook and serve it

our hunter gathering forefathers had to hunt to acquire food while our modern day humans have to work a 9-5 to acquire food. 

The most efficient hack I have discovered so far is to go hunter gathering at local food banks for weeks worth of supplies and then unloaded them at every camp I visit. 

This is my most recent hunter gathering hack if anyone is curious🤩🙏

Gary Teh,,"These past few weeks while sitting around doing nothing offline, I have been mulling this one question.

The question was posed to me by a fellow hacker at the HackerDojo down in Mountain View, Silicon Valley last year. while me and @16468233438 were serving out samples of our cacao drink

*_How do you measure biodiversity in an ecosystem and ensure that the cabruca system actually helps with biodiversity?*_

A few months ago I did manage to find a lot of mathematical formulas to measure biodiversity in an ecosystem. The most common one is the *_Shannon diversity index*_.

https://www.statology.org/shannon-diversity-index/ 

The math is easy, the main challenge lies in gathering the data and compiling the biodiversity index of a farm. 

Farmers are busy. And it’s comes across as additional work for what would be considered marketing purposes from their perspective

Working through the statistics and thinking through the available technology that is out there, seems the least effortful way to implement the measurement of this would be to use a drone mounted with a high resolution camera 

The video from the drone would be piped to an AI model that then identifies and quantifies all the different species of plants and animals surfaced in the video stream

And if we flew the drone in a fixed pattern across the farm from _east to west, north to south_ we should end up with a 80% accurate count of the different species in the environment 

If this same methodology is applied on all the farms we survey, we will end up with a good enough tabulation overtime. 

We can then justify why we decided to support one farm and not another farm.

And each farm in our support network will come associated with a Shannon index 

And people who buy our bags of cacao nibs could then scan the associated QR code and very quickly see the statistics of the farm the cacao is from. 

If we want ensure the records against being tempered, we could write the records on the blockchain signed with our key

That is how I would see AI and blockchain being implemented at the farm level ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240601
