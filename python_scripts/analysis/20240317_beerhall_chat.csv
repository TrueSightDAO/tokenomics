_PS: I was thinking if everyone in the DAO migrated over to the House of Balance there would technically be no further need to maintain TrueSight DAO or any of its channels_

_the values are quite aligned though the set of activities pursued are somewhat different_

_So long as no attempt is made to pursue any commercial enterprises, there is technically no need to maintain the tokens if everything is gift and donation based._

Gary Teh,"DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them.

Gary Teh,"My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"Negative statements are more *qualifiers* than they are *action rules*. 


_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples 


_scenario with qualifer and actual action associated_

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree. 

- *key action*: gather apples from apple trees in garden 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck the blue apples ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231212

- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels",Contributed Human Effort, 416,20231213

What will be interesting at some point would be to notarize all these submission records on to our own TrueChain (_Proof of Authority based EVM variant_) 

Records to be tokenized will be approved by one of the *_10 Governors*_ system appointed each season. There will be a user interface provided where governors can indicate their approval

Once governor indicates approval, TDG tokens on TrueChain will be automatically issued to DAO member’s Metamask wallet address on file 

DAO member can opt to keep their TDG holdings on TrueChain or request for DAO to have their TDG holdings transferred to either the Solana or Ethereum chain

Gary Teh,"Had a 10 minutes chat with @16468233438 just now

He has been calling up the chocolatiers in the USA 

Seems their minimal order quantity is 100KG and their price point is nothing more than USD6 per kg 

We been reexamining the cost components of our supply chain

Seems we are paying a lot more for freighting than we are for the cacao itself 

The freighting is still using diesel which is not very environmentally friendly supply chain wise 

@16468233438 floated the idea of perhaps owning our own ship. 

@41765663130 mentioned he is planning to sail the carribeans end of January and then head over to Columbia to visit the indigenous 

Wind powered transportation is definitely very eco friendly 🤔

From farmers, the prices have been varying from 80kes to 100kes per kg of the raw product. I will share a photo from our farm.

However, depending on the level of value addition the bags in supermarkets go for 600kes to over 800kes for 250grams. This value add is typically roasting and salting.

For the very premium ones, they go for as high as 250 kes for 30grams.

Gary Teh,"I am noticing a recurring pattern… 

ideas and discussions happening in DAO being taken and incorporated into members own independent project 

The most recent one that got surfaced by @41799155602 this morning was by Satheesh (the Ahan project) which borrowed from RnD materials done in Agroverse. The Ahan deck was sent to @41799155602 for fund raising purposes. 

Until @41799155602 surfaced this, I had no idea Satheesh was approaching supporters of Agroverse project to seek financing for an alternate project that had borrowed RnD materials from Agroverse.

This copy and paste phenomena seems to be common in the realms of open source too

_PS: at this point, I am leaning towards being skeptical about the DAO model as a *equitable way* to crowd source for resource to build community projects as the same flaws which exist in open source software operating models are starting to surface in DAO ecosystem as well_

_microsoft for years have been copying and pasting code created in open source projects to build up their OS. Bulk of the market capitalization ended up getting attributed to Microsoft and none of it ever end up getting attributed to these open source efforts_

_as @5511982667030 correctly identified DAO seems to be like a leaky bucket in terms of value generation and capture… value is generated by collective effort but seems to keep getting captured elsewhere_

_I am right now holding off on pouring more personal resources into this leaky bucket until a better alternate variant is discovered…_

_at least it is good to discover a model that doesn’t really work well. This helps us free resources to figure out other models that might work 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 2,20231227
Gary Teh,"If I was a hustler the way I would exploit this network would be to download the entire member contact list and then reach out to every single one of them individually to help  finance my own project… the common term for this phenomena is called “_contacts mining_” as described by @41799155602

However since bulk of the folks here were invited by me into our DAO from my personal network, there is technically no one new for me to *_social mine*_ 🤣 

So whether this DAO continue to exist or not doesn’t really matter for me from a networking perspective as my personal relationship with everyone here will still continue existing regardless 🤔

I think the primary reason for this persistence is I did spent ample time to really know each and every person here as a human being. 🙂🙏

I feel it’s important we learn to stop just treating the next person beside us as just another tool.

Vlatko Gigov,This usually happens when you practice maximum transparency. Which has been the case with the DAO since the beginning. It is fine if we are here to support one another and produce spin offs through our participation and chit chat. @5511982667030 rightly points to the leaky bucket analogy. I guess one needs the validation of 100s of ppl to go off on a tangent. Which is again fine. As long as the initial values are preserved.

Spent bulk of today exploring the world’s largest wholesale precious gem fair! 🤩

And it’s totally amazing!! Also managed to bump into an ex-Olympic USA swimmer. She mentioned she will be in Paris to volunteer at the swimming event during summer this year! 

Time spent: 4 hours 

Key insights 

- each spot on the open desert rents for 15 days 

- ⁠renting period officially begins 1 January and last through to February 

- ⁠none precious gen vendors set up as early as October 

- ⁠USA precious gem miners typical work 11 months in a year mining the land they have contracted with state and county until weather turns ultra bad before they seek refuge here in QuartzSite

- ⁠retail price is typically a 100% markup on whole sale price

- ⁠other places where precious gem are sourced from: China, Brazil, Uruguay and Afghanistan

Gary Teh,"Now that we have established market price for our (_freely available_) clay supply, this becomes really interesting 🤔🤩

We could technically start backing our governance tokens with clay which technically has an indefinite storage period compared to organic materials like cacao and we technically don’t even need to worry about people stealing our clay since there are tons of those where those came from. 🤩

Also since the whole site is full of trash, no one will every want to develope the land for commercial purposes because government ordinance  require that they spend millions of dollars cleaning up the trash (_accumulated over 50 years 🤯_) before they are even allowed to ever build anything on it..  😱

Everytime we sell this freely available commodity on Amazon or to one of our distributors our fiat deposit increases. And our supply is technically protected by the U.S. government 🤔🤣

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum.

_Key insights_

- it is possible to have *Integrity* (_core value_) without need for Transparency (_not core value_)

_Follow up action_

- future useful insights gathered that are not tokenizable will no longer be shared within these channels (_DM me if you are keen to find out where the category of untokenized  insights are published and shared_)

- ⁠this will further reduce the amount of post within our WhatsApp channels 

- ⁠if two or more DAO members are present, visual submissions will no longer be a requirement to prove that DAO contribution has transpired 

- ⁠Governors retain the right to request for proof when in doubt

what are your thoughts on the China wobbling economy on activities within our DAO? ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20240122
Vlatko Gigov,"Very interesting question, I’m eager to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from people in that part of the world. Not an expert on Chinese economics. I only come across so much made in China stuff as i am sure you all do. Do we need all that? 🤔",Unknown, 0,20240122
Alessandro Mele,Indeed really interesting question. I guess it depends on our exposure to the Chinese economy : do we have any members living there who might be affected? How do they see the situation and it’s impact on their lives? And do we have any partner or supply chain exposure there? There might be repercussions on the cost of supplies for instance or a reduction in sales from clients in the region. The fact that our DAO is a fairly small and agile organisation should make us resilient and flexible to adapt to chancing macroeconomic situations.,Unknown, 0,20240123
Vlatko Gigov,"Indeed. Looking at it from a macro perspective and how the majority of synthetic/petrochemicals products/by products come from China, the supply chain aspect will be affected. China could end up raising prices, to fill up the coffers. Leaving room for the cradle to cradle circular economy aspect to gain traction @41765737357 is an expert in c2c field. Very strong in the recycled packaging field. Might be interesting to explore partners in China who will adopt these practices…

Craig Henderson LaTokens,"The market will eventually decide the rate, but there has to a price for the initial listing to have a starting point. After the first initial trades the price will be determined by market sentiment. I think a better way to do it is set whatever price you want the listing to be and have the IEO be at a discounted price, So an example could be to set the listing price at 1USD per TDG. Prior to the listing IEO participants can be given the chance to by at $0.80/TDG. Have a cap on the IEO say 75% of allocated tokens.The remaining tokens can be used for co-marketing activities and the liquidity for the trading pair. The trading pair can be opened with as little as $250TDG/$250USDT but the more liquidity the lower the less volatile the price will be and have better spreads on the buys/asks",Unknown, 0,20240131
Gary Teh,"I see

It might make sense to do the following

We don’t really need much upfront investment. Just need to get a plot of land to setup the initial prototype

For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this.

Gary Teh,"Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.",Unknown, 0,20240207

- Green Up is a non-profit Swiss association
- ⁠Explored how Green Up operates projects and events in Switzerland
- ⁠One of the most popular workshop offered by Green Up to cooperations is how to live simply
- ⁠how foundations that provide financing to Green Up projects work

potential areas for interfacing
- Green Up has done a bunch of research on living simply and soil restoration. We could potentially utilize the research materials to identify prototypes we want to test and implement for testing in the SunMint Project. Those that we have tested to work in our SunMint project we can then compile as a handbook that Green Up could use in their workshops
- We could learn from operating processes that Green Up follows when running volunteer based events
- ⁠There has been a bunch of folks in our DAO that have proposed that I write a book at some point. I think the most useful book I could probably come up with right now is basically a blueprint that people can follow to implement the minimal carbon footprint off-grid setup I have right now. I will contribute that as materials to the workshop that Green Up workshop
- ⁠Foundations that Green Up is in communications with in Switzerland that are associated retailing distribution would be helpful for distributing Agroverse produce growing using environmentally restorative techniques. We should support the farmers ‎<This message was edited>

Craig Henderson LaTokens,"Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity—facilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.",Contributed Human Effort, 266,20240215

If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.",Contributed Human Effort, 3,20240227

Something clicked in my head just now when looking through this afternoon’s qualitative signals 

Each physical human body has a configuration range where it’s considered healthy. The body’s consciousness intuitively knows that

Nature does not do anything extraneous. When the body is healthy. It is naturally attractive regardless of biological age. 

These influencers from today’s marketing outreach efforts intuitively know their current configuration is not within the healthy range and trying to restore balance to their internal system 

Gaia (_the universe_) is attempting to restore balance not just in the rainforest but also in the human body ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 1,20240306
Gary Teh,"When the world is healed with love, beauty is the by-product 

Consciousness intuitively knows beauty when it beholds it within its field of awareness.

Beauty can exist in the physical body or in the natural environment 

Beauty is a natural indicator of health within an organism as well as the ecosystem.

Consciousness is naturally drawn to love and beauty. ‎<This message was edited>
