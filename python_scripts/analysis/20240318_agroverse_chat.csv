People who wants to cash out their TDG for fiat needs to go exchange them at official venues

When I studied the tokenomics presented to me by Nio in Dubai (_*who does pump and dump professionally*_) that is usually the back door he uses to drain the fiat from any tokenomics system he comes up with

Gary Teh,"*_Proposed compensation plan*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply",Contributed Human Effort, 100,20231203

Gary Teh,"Current pricing based on *3KG* from cooperative definitely will not match his target price… 

Current rate is at *USD6.15* per pound

Perhaps check with Orlantildes to see what his price is 

Worst case scenario, since the purpose of Agroverse is to help restore the rainforest, then perhaps Agroverse could consider foregoing all profit taking from future transactions 

_*Scenario A: If potential USA buyers have their own FSVP process already setup*_

 we could consider just providing them the contact details of Orlantildes and they could just deal with Orlantildes directly. 

Meanwhile we stop further deployment of human effort behind Agroverse initiative and if human effort does get involved, people contributing effort should just consider it *_charity work*_

*_Scenario B: if potential USA buyer does not have FSVP process setup and wants to utilize Agroverse FSVP infrastructure*_

We charge a fixed one off fee for each purchase

But buyer will have to conduct all the aliasing themselves and logistics arrangements themselves

Service provided by Agroverse should just be considered a self service solution with minimal to no hand holding provided by any DAO member

Ideally the Agroverse website should just allow them to simply fill up a form and pay up to receive shipment from all prevetted FSvP approved cooperatives

Vlatko Gigov,💫 welcome @41764184108 it is here where we aim to disintermediate the supply chain and bring greater value to farmers. Starting with cacao nibs and sustainable farming methods while protecting the amazon rain forest in Brazil. ❤️,Contributed Human Effort, 1,20240206
Gary Teh,"@16468233438 I relooked into our costing of our most recent shipment from Brazil into USA

*Cost of the goods itself*
- 100KG cacao nibs: $R6500 = USD1,310.3846

*Cost of the transportation and customs* 
- _Leitl Express_ - Trucking from Ilheus to Salvador: $R1066.85 = USD215.11019
- _Omega Services_ - Air Freight from Salvador to SF Airport: $R4000 = USD806.53795
- _SeaCoast Logistics_ - Custom Clearance at SF Airport: USD561.03

If our goal is to bring cost per KG down to USD20 and still pay the farmers the fair price they are asking for than shipping and freighting cost needs to go down. 

Four options to optimize our supply chain bound for USA
- ⁠Find cheaper freight forwarding company
- ⁠Do sea freight instead of air freight
- Increase shipping volume to acquire economies of scale. _but first we need to decipher which cost is fixed and which cost is variable_
- ⁠Figure out how to do customs clearance ourselves to save on the USD561.03 by removing SeaCoast Logistics from the equation. _Doesn’t feel like Grazie is actually doing much for us but still charging us stuff_.

The ledger of records for the shipment could be found here

Patrick - Davos,"Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.",Unknown, 0,20240207

Gary Teh,@31641075825 could you send me the clip which you made of the cacao ceremony? I need it for TikTok life streaming challenge,Unknown, 0,20240312
Gary Teh,"@554792591729 could you help source for the contact details of more cooperatives based in Bahia that sells organic cacao nibs

@16468233438 feels that the price we are getting from the current cooperative we are working with is not competitive. We need to do a price check against other cooperatives in the region. 

Thanks 🙂🙏

I just remembered, I had a conversation with Victor late last year. I mentioned I will follow up with him once we figured out our initial supply chain of cacao nibs into USA. He has a contact list for supply chain that will absorb up to 22 tons per month of chocolate into just San Francisco Bay Area
