About the color, light changes the color of the nibs. So, since the factory the nibs must be packed with a material that protects from sunlight.\n\n- Taste - the characteristics that define the flavor are: (1) disstringency and (2) acidity. We will need to determine the \u201cacceptable range\u201d.\n\n- Regarding Acidity - what determines acidity is: (1) fruit variety, (2) fermentation and (3) drying process.

The result of this poll is who will define the future of the business. \n\n2 - To avoid any setbacks, I have another factory that is also interested in certification, but we would need to order, at the beginning, 1 ton of nibs, or we would have to pay their share of the certification. \n\n3 - If we start with the market, according to item 1, that sales flow you sent me can be better estimated and the risks minimized, in addition to showing the factory more concrete numbers.",

About the color, light changes the color of the nibs. So, since the factory the nibs must be packed with a material that protects from sunlight.\n\n- Taste - the characteristics that define the flavor are: (1) disstringency and (2) acidity. We will need to determine the \u201cacceptable range\u201d.\n\n- Regarding Acidity - what determines acidity is: (1) fruit variety, (2) fermentation and (3) drying process. It\u2019s possible to adjust in order to get a more suitable taste for Americans. ",
