PROFESSIONAL REFERENCE FOR FATIMA TOLEDO

I provide my strongest recommendation for Fatima Toledo, an invaluable strategic contributor to TrueSight DAO and Agroverse over four years (June 2021 - August 2025).

As Technical Lead of TrueSight DAO, I've worked closely with Fatima connecting Brazilian cacao/açaí producers with North American markets—navigating between traditional business stakeholders (cooperative presidents, farm owners) and modern lean startup methodologies.

Fatima has been the critical bridge connecting these worlds.

• Translated technical specifications into actionable requirements

WHY FATIMA EXCELS

Fluent in BOTH traditional business (hierarchical decision-making, relationship-building, formal protocols) AND lean startup methodology (rapid iteration, data-driven decisions, market validation).

She translates between them: reframes "move fast" into "prudent testing"; converts startup jargon into accessible language; helps senior executives embrace lean approaches without feeling threatened.

RECOMMENDATION

For organizations seeking an executive who bridges gaps between senior leadership and younger, lean startup-oriented teams—Fatima Toledo is exceptional.

Companies with senior management from older generations competing with agile competitors benefit from her ability to reduce friction, accelerate lean adoption, preserve institutional knowledge while enabling rapid iteration, and drive respectful transformation.

I give Fatima my highest recommendation without reservation. She is a strategic asset bridging generational divides that define competitive advantage today.
