Reviewed the marketing strategy and the deliveries, the monthly content matrix, and discussed the metrics to follow for August planning.\n\n2. Addressed the content matrix to check competencies and distribute tasks based on Matheus's delivery possibilities (time to create, edit, buy ingredients to create the recipes, send me for review and with me, help with the art content for the posts).\n\n3. We inspected the creation studio where the reels and materials will be produced during the recordings. We checked the lighting, location, and equipment. As a request from @14153000019 and agreed by me and Matheus, all the video content and event content (photos, videos) from the community will follow some requirements established by me to be attached to the Marketing Strategy paper and after Gary's analysis, submitted and open to the DAO.",

The limit is 5.2). I spent 5 minutes talking with Je\u0301ssica. The official report is not available yet, so we received that as information as I requested. We will still receive the official report.\n\n2.        Based on this, I spent 25 minutes talking with Carlos arranging the quantity and the logistics. About the quantity: with the previous information on Fernando\u2019s test we went low on -100kg available. Talking with Carlos, I could reach to 270kg of Carlo\u2019s almonds to surpress our deficit with Fernando. We won\u2019t have 400kg total, instead we\u2019ll have 370 kg. 100kg almonds from Fernando and 270kg from Oscar. \n\n3.        On the logistics: I was informed that 24th-25th September, we would have 150kg from Oscar in 24th \u2013 25th September and then, in the second week of october, we would have more 120kg, totallizing 270kg from him. My suggestion is to wait until the second week of October, around 7th-9th to take the almonds in Oscar\u2019s farm. \n\n4.        About Oscar\u2019s almonds test: the test will be made this month yet. As they will come from the same batch, we only need to test once. So when we go to Oscar\u2019s farm, second week of October, we will take the entire amount, 270kg and deliver to CIC for processing. \n\n5.        As we deal with nature\u2019s will, if the weather gets this stable, the dates confirms. If it rains it may vary.",

The limit is 5.2). I spent 5 minutes talking with Je\u0301ssica. The official report is not available yet, so we received that as information as I requested. We will still receive the official report.\n\n2.        Based on this, I spent 25 minutes talking with Carlos arranging the quantity and the logistics. About the quantity: with the previous information on Fernando\u2019s test we went low on -100kg available. Talking with Carlos, I could reach to 270kg of Carlo\u2019s almonds to surpress our deficit with Fernando. We won\u2019t have 400kg total, instead we\u2019ll have 370 kg. 100kg almonds from Fernando and 270kg from Oscar. \n\n3.        On the logistics: I was informed that 24th-25th September, we would have 150kg from Oscar in 24th \u2013 25th September and then, in the second week of october, we would have more 120kg, totallizing 270kg from him. My suggestion is to wait until the second week of October, around 7th-9th to take the almonds in Oscar\u2019s farm. \n\n4.        About Oscar\u2019s almonds test: the test will be made this month yet. As they will come from the same batch, we only need to test once. So when we go to Oscar\u2019s farm, second week of October, we will take the entire amount, 270kg and deliver to CIC for processing. \n\n5.        As we deal with nature\u2019s will, if the weather gets this stable, the dates confirms. If it rains it may vary.",

I confirmed that even using VPN, Instagram is still suggesting people that live in Brazil as it reads a pattern of our followers, it is still a response of the number of Brazilians we had due to the content generated in Brazil and the connections established here in Gary's travel. It also influenced the posting time generated on Instagram as it shows the time of our Brazilian followers as they are many. The decision is to abandon this time suggestion. So for Brazil, the videos and images must be published around 14:00 and 16:00 as it would be 10:00 am and 12:00 pm in the US.",
