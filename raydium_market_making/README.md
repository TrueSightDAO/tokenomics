 # Raydium Market Making

 This folder contains experimental market making scripts for the Raydium AMM on Solana.

 The default, working implementation is in TypeScript under `raydium_type_script/`. To get started with the TypeScript version, see `raydium_type_script/README.md`.

 An experimental Python-based implementation exists under `raydium_py/`, but it did not work reliably and is not maintained.

 Directory structure:
 - `raydium_type_script/`: TypeScript-based market making scripts (default working implementation).
 - `raydium_py/`: Python-based market making attempt (not fully functional).

 Please refer to each subdirectoryâ€™s README for detailed setup and usage instructions.
