### Google Apps Script Deployment

- Open the Google Apps Script editor from a Google Sheet or at script.google.com.
- Copy the relevant `.gs` files from the respective subfolder into your project.
- Configure API keys and other settings as described in the subfolder's `README`.

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely using Google Apps Script's Properties Service or an external configuration method.
- Be aware of rate limits for external APIs (Wix, Solana, LATOKEN, xAI, OpenAI, Telegram).
- Validate all external data to prevent processing errors or security issues.
