Gary Teh,,"*New proposal surfaced for voting*

It’s observed that it is unintuitive and effortful for DAO members to vote on Gas Fee that should be charged for utility provided by DAO projects. Hence DAO Gas fee often remains static and outdated and none-reflective of actual market circumstances.

_Proposed solution_
Gas fee be calculated based on the following formula

_The higher of the two values_

- *Value 1*: Current 1 Month Treasury Yield:
Sample view: https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/xml?data=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2024

- ⁠*Value 2*: USDT1 - Last Price in USDT of TDG traded on LATOKEN exchange

But it becomes a very equitable way to split profit between financiers and DAO operators for the @120363044028036610@g.us shipment 

What I noticed right now is the gas fee charged for the @120363044028036610@g.us is so low, monetary incentive for DAO members to contribute is low

After a long while of discovering and ping pongs (specifically me annoying gary) of figuring out how to help more efficiently in this environment. 

After months of pitching and nagging over every bit of my personal network and beyond.  succeeded to reach a good potential result.

At this stage I would need assistance into refining the deal for it to be accepted by the consensus of the members here.

Proposal :
 Partnership with non profit tech lab
How? 
They can subsidize the hiring of junior talent from tech and business fields

Up to 15k eur per talent

This was drawn under a deal that we called it "" the de risking of hiring juniors ""

The aim behind this deal is to up skill talent and job creations for Palestinians in Jerusalem (one of the very few totally unserved communities of the world)

[9/12/24, 10:15:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240911
